<h1 title="">Ticktock and Jim</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />Chapter One
<br />The Trade</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has to stay home to give Colonel
Flesher that Jersey calf,&rdquo; said Mr. Meadows.
&ldquo;Since we are the only men around the place,
it looks as if you&rsquo;re elected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K. I&rsquo;ll stay. I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Jim answered
cheerfully, if not too accurately. He did mind very
much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure everything will be safe with you,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Meadows as he climbed in the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll take care of things,&rdquo; said Jim nonchalantly.</p>
<p>He watched the car drive off. His father, mother
and sister Jean were all going into town for the
afternoon while he stayed at home alone. He felt
rather proud that his father had called him a man,
but that didn&rsquo;t make up for the disappointment of not
going with them. He went over to sit on the edge of
the front porch, where he forlornly kicked his heels
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
against the lattice work. It was a beautiful spring
day with a warm sun shining, but Jim was in no
mood to appreciate the wonders of nature. His small
brown face looked very mournful as he sat there
feeling sorry for himself. Something exciting was
certain to happen in town, and he would miss it. He
wondered how long the family had been gone now.
Jumping up, he ran inside the house and returned
with a large gold watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quarter past one,&rdquo; he said aloud. Doubtfully, he
held the watch to his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ticktock, ticktock,&rdquo; came the answer.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible that it was only a quarter
past one; it would be almost four hours before the
family returned. Although it was a form of treason
to doubt that watch, Jim peered through the kitchen
door to compare it with the kitchen clock. The watch
was right. It promised to be a long dismal afternoon.</p>
<p>To pass away the time he polished the gold case
with his big red bandanna. The watch was his most
prized possession; his father had given it to him
on his twelfth birthday, almost eight months before.
He wore it only on special occasions or when he was
feeling sad, like today. Carefully he unscrewed the
back and looked at the shiny works. The balance
wheel was going back and forth quietly and faithfully.
Jim polished the inside of the back cover and
reread the inscription for the hundredth time. &ldquo;To
James Meadows from Elizabeth, June 7, 1884.&rdquo;
Over sixty years ago his grandmother had given that
watch to his grandfather and it was still bright and
shiny, and kept perfect time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it would run a little faster this afternoon
though,&rdquo; said Jim, as he placed the watch in his
overall watch pocket.</p>
<p>Feeling a tiny bit more cheerful, he walked
toward the orchard fence. A gentle breeze was blowing
toward him, bringing the delicate scent of apple
blossoms. He leaned on the fence, inhaling deeply
and gazing at the riot of blossoms in the orchard.
When it is spring in southern Missouri, one must
have a very deep sorrow to remain downhearted
long. Jim, being young and normally very healthy,
was recovering his spirits rapidly. He wrinkled his
short nose and after inhaling the odor of apple
blossoms again, decided that he would go closer to
the trees. Now that no one was about he might even
break off a sprig of blossoms. Having a healthy fear
of appearing a sissy, he would never think of doing
such a thing if his sister Jean were present. Flowers
were for girls as far as he was concerned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>He was halfway across the orchard when he remembered
the bull. The big red bull was Mr. Meadows&rsquo;
pride and joy but Jim&rsquo;s pet abomination. He
was afraid of it and very reasonably so, as it was a
mean-tempered animal. Feeling rather panicky, Jim
turned to hurry back toward the gate. It was too
late. Unnoticed, the bull had slipped behind him and
was now blocking the way. The big animal was
standing very quietly, looking straight at Jim. There
was a wicked look in the bloodshot eyes that indicated
plainly that he had no intention of remaining
quiet long.</p>
<p>With a sinking sensation in his stomach, Jim
looked around frantically, trying to figure which
fence was the closest. It was rather a tossup as to
distance. Choosing the fence bordering the road as
being the easiest to climb, he began backing cautiously
toward it, keeping his eyes on the hostile
bull.</p>
<p>As Jim made up his mind which way to move, so
did the bull. He snorted several times, pawed the
ground ferociously, lowered his head and charged
toward the boy. The powerful feet dug into the soft
ground as the big body gathered speed in a ponderous
rush. Jim knew he would never make the fence
in time. He was frightened, but not too frightened
to think. Once the huge bull was up to top speed he
couldn&rsquo;t change direction quickly. As the thundering
feet drew dangerously close, the boy darted
quickly to the right and ducked behind the nearest
apple tree. The bull swerved and roared by like an
avalanche.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>Jim was safe for a moment, but he knew he would
not have long to wait until the bull charged again.
The animal had turned around and was pawing and
snorting. Reluctantly Jim gave up all ideas of reaching
the fence. He grabbed the lowest branch of the
apple tree and swung his stocky body upward. He
was just in time, for the bull rushed underneath him
like an express train.</p>
<p>Giving a whistle of relief, the boy climbed higher.
Finding what appeared to be a comfortable perch,
he settled down to consider the situation. Apparently
he would simply just have to sit there and hope the
bull would forget him. The bull decided to play a
waiting game too. He pawed and snorted for a time
and then calmed down. Although he grazed quietly,
he showed no signs of leaving the vicinity. Just as
Jim would begin to grow hopeful, the animal would
lift his head and gaze balefully up into the tree. This
began to appear very one-sided to Jim after a few
minutes. While the bull could amble around at his
ease, the most Jim could move was a few inches.
What had appeared a comfortable seat began to
grow very irksome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>He shifted around trying to find a soft spot. It
was impossible. One spot was as bad as another.
There was a limit as to how long one could sit comfortably
in an apple tree. Now Jim grew really sorry
for himself. How he wished he could have gone into
town with his family. That was the most exciting
event of the week. First they took the cream to the
Springdale Creamery, where he could walk around
inhaling the clean smell of steam and butter. It was
fascinating to watch the huge revolving churns. He
supposed today would be one of those times when
Mr. Slemak would offer everyone a drink of cold
buttermilk.</p>
<p>The grocery store was fun too. Probably Jean was
sampling the cookies now. When his father paid the
grocery bill there was always a bag of candy for
both him and Jean. He hoped Mr. Higgins wouldn&rsquo;t
forget him just because he wasn&rsquo;t along. Jim sighed
miserably. Instead of smelling the odor of newly
ground coffee, here he was up in a tree smelling
apple blossoms. The scent which was so wonderful
before was getting rather tiresome now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a mess!&rdquo; he said to himself. He looked
down at the bull, his anger mounting. &ldquo;Go away, you
big dope!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>That did no good either. Jim remained uncomfortably
in the tree. To make matters worse, bees
began to buzz around entirely too close to his head.
Holding on to the tree with one hand and swatting
at bees with the other was not pleasant exercise.
Suddenly he remembered he hadn&rsquo;t closed the orchard
gate behind him. If the bull did wander away,
he would be perverse enough to head straight for the
gate. The yard gate was open too, so the way onto
the road was clear. Once he was out on the road
there was no telling where the animal might stray.
Now Jim was torn between hoping the bull would
go away and wanting him to stay. Either way, he
decided he was in a pickle. His parents would either
come home to find him trapped in the apple tree or
else would find the bull loose and strayed to parts
unknown.</p>
<p>The thought of Colonel Flesher came like a ray of
light. The stock buyer was supposed to arrive about
three o&rsquo;clock. If the bull were still standing guard
beneath the tree, the colonel could come to the rescue
and all would be well. Jim shifted his perch slightly
and hoped the stock buyer would arrive soon. It
seemed as if he had been in the tree for hours. He
reached in his pocket but his hand found nothing.
With a horrible sinking feeling he realized his precious
watch was gone. It must have bounced out of
his pocket while he was racing for the tree. With an
effort he kept back the tears. He looked back along
his recent path, hoping to catch the glint of gold.
There was nothing in sight but the new green grass.
If the bull had trampled on it during his mad rush,
the watch was probably broken and buried in the
soft earth. Completely dejected now, Jim sat in the
tree and mourned. It was certainly a heartbreaking
day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>He was so deep in his misery that he did not notice
a strange cavalcade coming over the hill until the
creaking of wagon wheels and the neighing of a horse
caused him to look up in surprise. The procession,
which was nearing the yard gate, was so unusual
and interesting that Jim forgot his woes and stared
in excited curiosity. First there was the oddest
wagon he had ever seen. It was a large wagon with
a sort of house built on the chassis. The house had a
flat roof which stuck out in front and overhung the
driver&rsquo;s seat, and the board sides contained two
small windows. Initially Jim thought it was a ranch
chuck wagon, for he had been reading Western
stories; but then he changed his mind and decided it
was more like a circus wagon or like the wagons he
had seen in the movies used by traveling road troupes
in the old days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<div class="img" id="p8">

</div>
<p>Seated on the high driver&rsquo;s seat was an old man in
a sombrero, whistling cheerfully and clucking to a
team of huge black horses. The team was ambling
along slowly, drawing the wagon with effortless ease.
But what attracted Jim&rsquo;s gaze most was the procession
following the wagon. Strung out behind were
at least twenty horses of all sizes and colors&mdash;big
gray Percherons, medium-sized brown horses, sorrels,
some dark bays, light grays and a few whites.
Jim looked at each horse in turn until finally he
came to the last in the string&mdash;a lean little mouse-colored
horse whose small body contrasted oddly
with the other broad-rumped work horses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>The fascinating cavalcade drew still nearer until
it reached the gate. The driver gave a slight tug on
one rein and the wagon started turning. Jim was so
interested and delighted that he almost lost his seat
in the tree. The strange wagon and all those horses
were coming in their yard! Almost doubting his eyes,
he saw the vehicle progress down the lane and come
to a halt, the long string of horses bunching up behind
the wagon until they too finally stopped. The
old man climbed down from his high perch and
looked around inquisitively. Seeing no one in the
yard he started toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody home but me,&rdquo; shouted Jim
loudly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>The stranger turned around to look toward the
orchard, and Jim got his first good view of the visitor.
He was a tall stringy individual with a long
gray handle-bar mustache that drooped from his
upper lip and hid much of the lower part of his face.
He was obviously a very old man, but there was nothing
old about his movements nor the way his bright
eyes searched in the direction from which the voice
had come. He looked puzzled, for all he could see was
apple blossoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where are you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m up here in a tree,&rdquo; said Jim, poking his black
thatched head as far through its frame of apple
blossoms as he dared. &ldquo;The bull won&rsquo;t let me climb
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treed are you?&rdquo; asked the man, laughing at
what Jim didn&rsquo;t think was a funny situation. &ldquo;Just
how mean is that bull?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad handles him without any trouble,&rdquo; replied
Jim. &ldquo;Once in a while he has to hit him on the nose
with a stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be with you in a minute.&rdquo; The stranger hunted
around until he found a big piece of wood for a
club.</p>
<p>The bull decided he wasn&rsquo;t quite so ferocious when
he saw a determined man approaching with a sizable
club. He gave a few disgruntled snorts and then ambled
off to the far end of the orchard. Thankfully
Jim climbed down from his uncomfortable haven.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mister,&rdquo; he said with feeling. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve
got to find my watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried back along the path of his recent flight
from the bull, searching the ground anxiously. About
thirty feet from the tree he found his watch, lying
bright and shining in the sun. He picked it up and
held it to his ear. It was ticking away merrily. With
a huge sigh of relief, Jim put the watch in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really got me out of a mess,&rdquo; he said, as they
walked toward the gate. &ldquo;I was trapped in that tree,
the orchard gate was open, and my watch was lying
on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks like a pretty good watch to be carrying
around in your overalls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the best watch in the world I guess,&rdquo;
said Jim proudly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t usually carry it every
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you can do me a good turn,&rdquo; said the
stranger as they went out of the gate, fastening it
this time. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to water my horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, bring them over to the tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim pumped more water into the big cement tank
while the man led his horses over to drink. First
he watered the team he was driving and then started
with the string of horses behind the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come you&rsquo;ve got so many horses?&rdquo; asked
Jim, his curiosity getting the better of his manners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a horse trader. Not many traveling horse
traders left any more. I usually have a lot more
horses than these, but I sold fourteen yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;it must be a lot of fun to have
so many horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is if you like horses. It&rsquo;s a lot of work too. Most
people find two or three too much to take care of the
way they should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you live in that wagon?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but about three months of the year,&rdquo; replied
the horse trader. &ldquo;Now let me ask a question. When&rsquo;s
your pa going to be home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About five o&rsquo;clock, I &rsquo;spect,&rdquo; Jim informed him.
He looked at his watch. It was not quite three. He
hadn&rsquo;t been in that tree nearly so long as he had
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think your pa will want to trade or buy any
horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; replied Jim. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got two
teams that are pretty good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man led the last horse to the trough for a
drink. It was the small brown horse that Jim had
noticed at the end of the string. It wasn&rsquo;t an impressive
horse at all. It was very thin, the hip bones making
big bumps as if they were trying to push their
way through the poor horse&rsquo;s hide. There was an
ugly, partially healed sore on his back, and he limped
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
slightly on his right foreleg. His coat was a shaggy
lusterless gray-brown. It was hard to tell what either
the tail or mane was like as both were so matted with
cockleburs and bits of weed. Lastly, the little horse
didn&rsquo;t hold his head as he should, but kept it cocked
to one side as if he were looking at something very
odd and interesting. To most horse fanciers this odd
position of the head would have been the crowning
defect of the long list, but it was just this feature
that attracted Jim. The pony seemed to be looking
at him quizzically. As Jim looked closer he was certain
he saw a twinkle in the horse&rsquo;s eye as if the
animal were trying to share some sort of joke with
him.</p>
<p>Jim stopped pumping water and moved closer to
the little horse. He was so painfully thin and that
sore looked so tender that Jim felt a surge of sympathy.
He wished the horse could stay there and rest.
The object of Jim&rsquo;s compassion lifted his muzzle
from the trough, shook his head, and snorted until
he had blown the water from his nostrils. Then he
looked squarely at the boy and winked. This time
Jim was certain the horse grinned too. It was very
plain what the pony meant. He seemed to say:
&ldquo;Thanks for the water and your kindness. I&rsquo;m rather
deceiving in appearance and am in much better
shape than most people would think.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Walking around to look at the horse from the
other side, Jim spied a mark on the pony&rsquo;s left
shoulder. It was an <i>H</i> lying on its side like this:</p>
<div class="img" id="p23">
<img src="images/p23.jpg" alt="Letter H lying on its side" width="50" height="43" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a brand, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked the boy excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. I reckon that is the lazy-<i>H</i> brand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a Western mustang. The man I
bought him from said a carload of cow ponies was
shipped in from Texas a couple of years ago. He
picked up this feller at the sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real Texas mustang,&rdquo; said Jim, reverently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bit small even for a Western cow pony,&rdquo;
said the trader, sitting down on the edge of the water
tank. &ldquo;In fact there&rsquo;s a lot of things about this horse
that are different from most mustangs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled the old man, filling his pipe, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
in no hurry to get up on that jolting seat again. Just
set here awhile and I&rsquo;ll tell you a little about Western
horses, specially this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell,&rdquo; said Jim enthusiastically. &ldquo;Can I hold the
horse?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>The old man passed over the halter rope and Jim
sat happily on the well platform holding on to the
end of the tether. The horse looked at both of them
for a moment and then calmly started to crop the
grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Western horses usually run pretty wild for three
years or so,&rdquo; began the old man. &ldquo;Then they&rsquo;re
broken for riding. They break Western horses quick
and rough and most of them buck every time they&rsquo;re
saddled. A ranch horse is worked only four or five
months a year and then only three or four days a
week. Most of them, except the favorites, never get
to know a man real well and so usually they don&rsquo;t
show much affection.&rdquo; He paused to relight his corn-cob
pipe. Reflectively he gazed on the glowing coal
and drew on the pipe stem noisily while Jim waited
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This little feller is different. Plenty of spirit, but
about as gentle a horse as I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Gentle,
that is, if he likes you. In the five days I&rsquo;ve had him
I can tell he&rsquo;d develop a real likin&rsquo; for anybody that
treated him at all reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he would,&rdquo; agreed Jim, looking at the
horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good horse, but I don&rsquo;t know just what I&rsquo;ll
do with him. He&rsquo;s not a work horse&mdash;too small for
heavy work. He&rsquo;s really a saddle horse and people
in these parts don&rsquo;t go much for saddle horses unless
they&rsquo;re rich people. Then they want something
fancy like a Kentucky saddle horse. But I felt sorry
for this critter and I bought him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Felt sorry for him? Why?&rdquo; asked Jim with
great interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was bein&rsquo; mistreated. You can&rsquo;t be a horse
trader for fifty years without becomin&rsquo; real fond of
horses. It gets you mad to see anyone treat an animal
mean. So I picked up this pony mainly to get him
away from the skunk that owned him. Look how thin
the horse is. Why I&rsquo;d bet money he hasn&rsquo;t had a
feedin&rsquo; of grain in the two years that man had him.
Of course, these Westerns are tough. They run wild
all winter and find feed where other breeds would
starve. But this pony was turned out in a field where
there wasn&rsquo;t enough grass. Nothing to eat except
straw. That strawstack was all the shelter he had
too. You can tell from that long shaggy hair that he
was out all winter. It will take a lot of curryin&rsquo; and
plenty of oats to get that coat in shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean he was out in the snow and everything?&rdquo;
asked Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snow isn&rsquo;t so bad. He&rsquo;s probably used to that.
But when horses run loose in the winter out West,
they don&rsquo;t have nothin&rsquo; else to do but hunt for feed.
This horse has been rode all winter too. See those
saddle galls?&rdquo; said the trader, pointing. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
recent. A horse can&rsquo;t do much work on a diet of straw
and then stay outside in the cold to boot. He needs a
layer of fat to keep him warm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did he get those saddle sores?&rdquo; inquired
Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been saddled wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look awful sore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were, but they&rsquo;re healing now that I&rsquo;m
givin&rsquo; them a little attention. If nobody rides him for
a while, they&rsquo;ll clear up all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lame too,&rdquo; pointed out Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, nail in his foot. The owner just pulled the
nail out&mdash;nothin&rsquo; else. I was sort of takin&rsquo; a chance
buyin&rsquo; the horse at all. He might have developed
lockjaw. Once a horse gets lockjaw you might as well
shoot him. But I pared out the hoof, soaked his foot
in a lysol solution, and worked some iodine into the
puncture. I&rsquo;ve given him a couple of treatments since
and he&rsquo;s out of danger now. In a week you&rsquo;d never
know he&rsquo;d stepped on a nail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The long story of the mustang&rsquo;s mistreatment and
ills had aroused Jim&rsquo;s sympathy. He looked at the
horse with even greater interest than before. Several
times the little horse raised his head and appeared
to give the boy a good-natured nod. The fact
that the pony was still gentle and apparently in high
good humor after all he had been through particularly
appealed to the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How much would you sell that horse for?&rdquo; he
asked impulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon he&rsquo;s worth about forty dollars,&rdquo;
said the old trader appraisingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said Jim sorrowfully. &ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s worth
that all right but I only got three bucks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid three dollars would be a mite too
cheap,&rdquo; said the man laughing. &ldquo;I know he looks like
three dollars now, but he&rsquo;ll shape up. Feed him properly
and take care of him and you&rsquo;d be surprised at
the improvement. I haven&rsquo;t had time to work on his
coat or tail but a few weeks would do a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six years, I figure. He&rsquo;s a good sound horse. You
take a good look and you&rsquo;ll see that he has his better
points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. On closer inspection the first bad impression
began to fade. The pony had a short barrel,
straight unblemished legs, and a deep chest. Aside
from their extreme thinness, his hind quarters were
well proportioned. Both eyes were bright, clear and
alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure looks like a good horse to me,&rdquo; said Jim
truthfully. He knew nothing about the finer points
of horses, but the little mustang appealed to him. He
liked the horse and that settled the matter. Naturally
he was a fine animal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is a good horse. No fancy gaited animal but
just a good sturdy ridin&rsquo; horse. Some of these days
I&rsquo;ll find someone who&rsquo;ll appreciate him and take good
care of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d appreciate him,&rdquo; thought Jim enviously.
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d take awfully good care of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently the horse read Jim&rsquo;s thoughts, for he
raised his head, cocked it even farther to one side,
and stared straight at the boy. It was a friendly
look that clearly said, &ldquo;Yes, I know, Jim; we&rsquo;d be
good friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorrowfully the boy watched the old trader tie
the mustang to the end of the string and then climb
up on his wagon. How he would like to own that
horse. A real mustang with a brand. He and that
pony certainly could have fun together.</p>
<p>The wagon turned around and started down the
lane. Jim felt as sad and lonely as if his best friend
were departing forever. If only he could have gone to
town. Then he would not have seen the little mustang
and wanted him so. He pulled out his watch.
Three-thirty. Time had passed rapidly enough while
he was looking at the mustang. Now it would drag
again. Suddenly he looked at the watch as if he were
seeing it for the first time. His grandfather&rsquo;s watch&mdash;his
most prized possession. He couldn&rsquo;t possibly
part with it. He raised his eyes and saw the mustang
going out the gate. Headlong he ran after the
wagon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Mister! Wait a minute please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse trader heard the frantic cry and pulled
his team to a halt. He looked down inquiringly as
Jimmy rushed up beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you trade that mustang for my watch?&rdquo;
Jim asked in a rush of words, as though afraid
that if he hesitated he would lose his nerve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I might now,&rdquo; answered the old man.
&ldquo;What kind of a watch is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Jim, pulling out his precious
watch. He stood on tiptoe to hand it up to the trader.</p>
<p>The old man examined the watch carefully while
Jim watched nervously. The trader held the watch
to his ear, removed the back and inspected the shiny
works.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, son,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;this is <i>your</i> watch,
isn&rsquo;t it? Not your father&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine, really mine,&rdquo; said Jim in desperate
eagerness to be believed. &ldquo;It was given to me on my
birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it? Would your father and mother
be mad if you traded it for a horse?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why. It&rsquo;s my watch,&rdquo; protested Jim.
The thought made him a little uneasy. He wondered
if they would care. His resolution began to waver.
Then he looked at the mustang and his doubts vanished.
How he&rsquo;d like to have that horse!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled the old man slowly, &ldquo;I got my
doubts about how this is goin&rsquo; to set with your pa.
But I know you want the horse more than you do the
watch. It wouldn&rsquo;t be an uneven trade either. This
is a good watch but not an awful expensive one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can have the horse?&rdquo; asked Jim in eager
anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sure that&rsquo;s what you want. I hate to
be the cause of any trouble though. Tell you what
I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll be back by here in about three, four
months. You tell your father that. My name&rsquo;s Ned
Evarts&mdash;Old Ned Evarts. In fifty years of horse
tradin&rsquo; no one has ever accused me of tellin&rsquo; a lie.
When I come back I&rsquo;ll still have the watch. If you&rsquo;re
not satisfied with the horse, we&rsquo;ll trade back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds fair,&rdquo; said Jim judiciously.</p>
<p>The trader reached inside the wagon and pulled
out a bridle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the bridle I got with the horse,&rdquo; he said,
climbing down from the wagon. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need a bridle,
so I&rsquo;ll throw that in. Now the horse has on a rope
halter. It doesn&rsquo;t look like much but it&rsquo;s sturdy. You
can have that too if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mister,&rdquo; said Jim, beginning to be overwhelmed
by all his new property.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell you something,&rdquo; said the old man.
&ldquo;There is such a thing as an honest horse trader even
if people don&rsquo;t think so. A trader that deals square
will tell a man about any defects that he knows of
inside the horse. About his wind, whether he has the
heaves, and things like that. Anything that shows
outside the horse, it&rsquo;s up to the buyer to see. If he
can&rsquo;t tell what he&rsquo;s buyin&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s his tough luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This horse looks all right to me,&rdquo; said Jim, stoutly
defending his new property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said the trader. &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re a young
feller and haven&rsquo;t had much experience tradin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;d
tell you if anything was wrong. This mustang hasn&rsquo;t
any defects we haven&rsquo;t already talked about. There&rsquo;s
that saddle sore, the lame foreleg, he&rsquo;s pretty lean,
and his coat needs a lot of work. Other than that he&rsquo;s
sound. Now I want you to take notice of the way he
holds his head. It&rsquo;s kinda cockeyed. Now lots of folks
would look at him and figure him to be a mean horse.
He isn&rsquo;t. That horse isn&rsquo;t a bit mean; he&rsquo;s been mistreated
and he&rsquo;s a little worried about whom to trust.
You be good to him and he&rsquo;ll be as gentle as can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll like me,&rdquo; said Jim confidently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think he will. One other thing&mdash;that mustang
is a smart critter. Horses are like people; some are
just naturally dumb and others are smart. I&rsquo;ve been
handling the animals so long I&rsquo;ve kinda got a sixth
sense about &rsquo;em. Now this little feller is one of the
smartest I&rsquo;ve ever run across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evarts untied the mustang from the end of the
string and handed the rope to Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s your horse. Good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said Jim as the trader climbed back
on the wagon. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good watch too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim watched the wagon, with its trailing string of
horses, move off down the road. He felt a twinge of
pain as he thought of his beloved watch slowly moving
into the distance. Then he felt a tug on the rope
he held. The horse was looking at him quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not sorry I traded,&rdquo; said Jim, as if in
answer to a question. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to miss that
watch. I know what I&rsquo;m going to do. I&rsquo;ll call you
&lsquo;Ticktock&rsquo; after my watch.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c2"><br />Chapter Two
<br />The Reception</h2>
<p>After tying Ticktock to the orchard fence, Jim
stepped back and regarded his property with
admiration. Ownership had caused the
mustang to take on new beauty in the eyes of the
boy. There were so many things to be done that Jim
was uncertain where to start. He had to feed the
pony, comb out his mane and tail, give him a good
grooming and do something about that saddle sore.
After much thought, Jim finally decided the most
important and most enjoyable thing to do was to
win his horse&rsquo;s confidence. He ran happily into the
house and down the cellar stairs. There were still a
few apples left, he knew from frequent trips to the
barrel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, Ticktock,&rdquo; he said, returning with
an apple. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a winesap and no worms in it either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cutting the apple in half, he carefully removed the
core and offered one-half in his outstretched hand.
Ticktock moved forward cautiously. After a few
moments of doubtful sniffing, he picked the apple
delicately from the boy&rsquo;s outstretched palm. He ate
it with obvious relish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liked it, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Jim, getting more
pleasure than if he had eaten the apple himself.</p>
<p>Ticktock didn&rsquo;t reply. He stuck his head forward
and sniffed at Jim&rsquo;s other hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;re pretty smart,&rdquo; said Jim admiringly,
as he gave the pony the remainder of the apple. &ldquo;You
know there&rsquo;s two halves to an apple.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>By this time Jim felt confident enough to begin
stroking the mustang&rsquo;s head. Next he gently
scratched the horse&rsquo;s ears. He knew dogs liked their
ears scratched, so why not horses? Ticktock didn&rsquo;t
seem to mind, for he stood patiently. Jim had progressed
as far as the neck when there was an interruption.
Colonel Flesher drove in the yard in his little
truck. The fleshy stock buyer climbed out of his car
and walked toward the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Colonel,&rdquo; said Jim, glad to see
the visitor. Now here was a man who would appreciate
the finer points of a beautiful horse. &ldquo;Come see
my mustang.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="p26">
<img src="images/p26.jpg" alt="Selling a mustang" width="500" height="207" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mustang, eh?&rdquo; asked Colonel Flesher jovially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. A real Western. Isn&rsquo;t he a beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Flesher looked at the little horse doubtfully.
He pursed his lips searching for the right thing
to say. The boy&rsquo;s enthusiasm left no doubt as to
what sort of answer was expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s a bit thin yet to be called a beauty,&rdquo; he
said, evading nicely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He may be a little thin,&rdquo; admitted Jim unwillingly,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll fix that up in no time. He&rsquo;s a Texas
ranch horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo; asked the colonel, glad to be off the
subject of the mustang&rsquo;s appearance. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you
get him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traded a gold watch for him. I made a fine deal.
He&rsquo;s worth a lot more than a gold watch, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that all depends on the watch,&rdquo; answered
the stock buyer cautiously. &ldquo;There are all sorts of
watches you know, some cheap, some valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen a watch that was worth half as
much as this horse,&rdquo; said Jim hotly, realizing that
Colonel Flesher wasn&rsquo;t too enthusiastic about Ticktock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m, well,&rdquo; hedged the colonel, trying to be
truthful and still not hurt the boy&rsquo;s feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait,&rdquo; said Jim confidently. &ldquo;Wait until I
get him spruced up a bit; then you&rsquo;ll see. He&rsquo;s probably
the smartest horse in the whole state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That could be true enough,&rdquo; said the stock buyer,
glad to find something on which they could agree.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to spend more time looking at him, son; but
I&rsquo;m in a big hurry. Can you tell me where the calf is
that I bought from your father?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Jim led the calf out of the barn and over to the
truck. The two carried a small stock chute to the
back of the truck. By dint of much pushing, pulling
and coaxing, the calf was finally loaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the fifteen dollars for the calf,&rdquo; said the
colonel. &ldquo;Thanks a lot for helping me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim returned to his horse. Colonel Flesher&rsquo;s lack
of approval didn&rsquo;t bother him in the least. He
shrugged his shoulders. After all the stock buyer
bought cows largely, and probably wasn&rsquo;t able to see
Ticktock&rsquo;s wonderful qualities. He went out to the
barn for a curry comb and brush. Now he hoped his
family wouldn&rsquo;t be back for hours. He had visions
of the mustang looking like a show horse by the time
they returned.</p>
<p>Currying Ticktock turned out to be a much bigger
job than Jim had anticipated. After the first ten
minutes he sadly conceded that it would be a matter
of weeks instead of hours before he could have the
pony&rsquo;s coat sleek and glistening. He tried unsuccessfully
to comb out a few strands of the matted mane
and gave up. Instead he started to work on a shoulder&mdash;that
looked easier. After twenty minutes of
hard work, he was resting his tired arms when the
family drove in the yard. Jim ran excitedly over to
the car, jumping on the running board as the car
stopped.</p>
<p>Since the driver&rsquo;s seat was on the side toward the
orchard, Mr. Meadows saw the mustang first.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where did that nag come from?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nag!&rdquo; said Jim, astounded. &ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s a real
Texas cow pony with a brand and everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Carl Meadows, grinning at his
son. &ldquo;Where did that real Texas cow pony come
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I traded for him,&rdquo; said Jim proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traded for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traded what?&rdquo; asked Jim&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gold watch. I got the horse, a halter and a
bridle, all for my watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Meadows said nothing, but the grin vanished.
Very slowly and grimly he got out of the car and
walked toward the horse. Mrs. Meadows and Jean
followed, all gathering in front of the mustang.
Ticktock stopped grazing and looked up inquiringly
at his suddenly large audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You traded your grandfather&rsquo;s gold watch for
<i>that</i>,&rdquo; Mr. Meadows asked finally, with a contemptuous
wave of his hand toward the horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh-uh.&rdquo; Jim sensed that matters were rapidly
becoming difficult, so he tried to ease the situation
as much as he could. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the smartest horse you
ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how smart the horse is,&rdquo; said his
father, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m beginning to have some doubts
about you, Jim. I gave you that watch because I
thought you would take care of it and appreciate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did appreciate it!&rdquo; cried Jim in a hurt
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough, apparently, to prevent you from
trading it off for a broken-down piece of horseflesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t broken-down,&rdquo; replied Jim, coming to
the defense of Ticktock. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a beautiful horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carl!&rdquo; said Mrs. Meadows sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s enough to make a man swear,&rdquo; said
Mr. Meadows. &ldquo;Jim, who palmed this crazy-looking
nag off on you? I&rsquo;m going to take it back and get
your watch back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to trade back,&rdquo; cried Jim. &ldquo;I want to
keep Ticktock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; repeated his father. Mr. Meadows&rsquo;
usually good-natured expression was replaced by one
of angry determination. Jim knew he had best
answer the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A traveling horse trader named Ned Evarts,&rdquo;
he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A traveling horse trader!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Meadows,
grabbing his head in his hands in despair. &ldquo;That is
the last straw. There&rsquo;s no telling where the rascal is
now. Still, I&rsquo;m so disgusted that I&rsquo;ve half a mind to
phone the sheriff to see if the man can be located.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, Dad,&rdquo; Jim pleaded. &ldquo;He asked me
if I was sure it would be all right with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well that is about as low a piece of swindling as
I&rsquo;ve ever encountered,&rdquo; said the older man, &ldquo;taking
advantage of a boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t a swindler. Besides, he said he&rsquo;d be
back this fall and if I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied, he&rsquo;d trade
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back this fall,&rdquo; scoffed his father. &ldquo;Why he&rsquo;ll
have that watch in the first pawn shop he finds. He&rsquo;s
probably laughing now at how he got rid of such a
broken-down old plug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miserable as he was, Jim was not going to let anyone
make remarks about Ticktock. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t broken-down
and he isn&rsquo;t old either. Only six years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six years old!&rdquo; said Mr. Meadows scornfully.
&ldquo;Why he&rsquo;s closer to sixteen. Did you look at his
teeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll show you something about your valuable
horse!&rdquo; said Carl Meadows, advancing toward Ticktock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>The mustang had been watching and listening to
the argument with interest. He couldn&rsquo;t understand
the words, but there was little else that he missed.
The frequent looks of contempt that Carl Meadows
had given him hadn&rsquo;t passed unnoticed. Ticktock
was a horse of considerable independence. He wanted
people to like him, but if they didn&rsquo;t, he wasted little
time in trying to win their favor. Affection was a
two-way affair with him. Mrs. Meadows and Jean
were neutral and puzzled respectively, so Ticktock
reserved judgment on them. But the mustang definitely
did not like the tall man. When Mr. Meadows
reached out confidently to open his jaws, Ticktock
promptly took a nip at one of the outstretched hands.
It wasn&rsquo;t a savage bite&mdash;just a moderate bite, as the
mustang didn&rsquo;t hate the strange man. He merely
didn&rsquo;t want to be handled by anyone who disliked
him. However, the nip was enough to take the skin
off one finger and draw blood.</p>
<p>Mr. Meadows jerked his arm back and really cursed
this time. He shook the injured hand and glared
with hatred at the pony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it. That mean-tempered beast has
got to go. I won&rsquo;t have a vicious horse on my place.
The next thing you know he will kill someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim was very alarmed at the accident. He hadn&rsquo;t
expected outright approval of his trade, but he certainly
had not anticipated such violent opposition.
Now the biting had climaxed the situation. He felt
sorry about his father&rsquo;s injured hand but somehow
he knew how Ticktock felt and was in sympathy with
him too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t vicious, Dad. He&rsquo;s just not used to you.
Look here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before his father could stop him, Jim stepped forward
and took hold of Ticktock&rsquo;s muzzle. He opened
the mustang&rsquo;s mouth easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to see his teeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thank you. I&rsquo;ve felt them; that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo; Mr.
Meadows was a very tolerant man, but he was
human and had a streak of stubbornness. He had
taken his stand and was not going to back down.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said all I&rsquo;m going to say about that horse.
Come help me get the groceries out of the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All through the chores Jim and his father maintained
strict silence about the mustang. Jim performed
his routine work from habit, for his mind
was busy with its overwhelming burden of misery.
After the chores he went quietly in the house and
washed for supper. During the meal he sat abjectly
staring at his plate, eating scarcely anything. Mr.
Meadows could not help noticing his son&rsquo;s misery;
but Jim&rsquo;s father was angry and determined, so he
too sat in tight-lipped silence. Mrs. Meadows maintained
her stand of complete neutrality. That left
only Jean, who had forgotten the argument and just
wondered why everyone was so silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>After supper Mr. Meadows went into the living
room. Jim waited a few minutes and then followed,
determined to make another attempt to change his
father&rsquo;s stand. Mr. Meadows had always been very
reasonable before. Jim&rsquo;s mother left the dishes and
went in the living room also, fearing a peacemaker
might be needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Dad,&rdquo; said Jim, trying to approach the
subject gradually, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an empty stall in the
barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said the horse was not going to stay,&rdquo; said Mr.
Meadows. &ldquo;I simply will not waste feed on a useless,
mean-tempered horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t use any feed,&rdquo; Jim pointed out. &ldquo;Just
grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the winter there is snow covering the grass,&rdquo;
said the older man dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll earn money this summer to feed him through
the winter!&rdquo; declared Jim confidently. &ldquo;Besides, I
already have three dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached in his pocket to make certain he still
had his precious three dollars. His hand found the
fifteen that Colonel Flesher had paid for the calf. In
the excitement he had forgotten to give the money to
his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the fifteen dollars Colonel Flesher gave
me for the calf.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Mr. Meadows pocketed the money. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good
thing he didn&rsquo;t come before the horse trader, or you
probably would have thrown in the fifteen dollars
with the watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not,&rdquo; said Jim bitterly. He was now even
more hurt than before. &ldquo;The money wasn&rsquo;t mine but
the watch was. You gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything seemed to mount up in Jim&rsquo;s mind.
He had felt like shedding tears several times since
his family&rsquo;s return, but he was no crybaby and had
held them back. Now once again he began to choke
up dangerously; so he started to leave the room.</p>
<p>Mr. Meadows began to be somewhat sorry about
his last words. He realized that in his anger he had
spoken rather hastily, and he saw his son was deeply
hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Jim,&rdquo; he said finally and rather awkwardly.
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that. I know you
would never be dishonest or trade off anything that
didn&rsquo;t belong to you. I did give you the watch and it
was your property. It&rsquo;s just that I attached a lot of
sentiment to the watch and thought you would too.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Mrs. Meadows had been weighing the problem all
evening. She hadn&rsquo;t been too favorably impressed by
Ticktock, but she knew with a mother&rsquo;s instinct how
precious the rawboned pony was to her son. Now
that her husband was in a slightly more softened
mood she decided to strike.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Carl, come in the kitchen a few minutes,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>As Jim waited anxiously, he could hear low voices
coming from the kitchen. He knew his parents as
well as they knew him and suspected that his mother
was coming to his rescue. When his parents returned
to the living room, Mrs. Meadows was looking determined
and a trifle triumphant, while her husband
was embarrassedly trying to look indulgent. Jim
sat up expectantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother and I have talked over this matter,&rdquo;
announced Mr. Meadows. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve decided to
arrive at a compromise with you. You can keep the
horse this summer providing he isn&rsquo;t too mean and
causes no trouble. But this fall he goes. I will not
feed him through the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Jim and dashed out of the
house.</p>
<p>When you are not quite thirteen a summer is a
lifetime. The fall seemed a million years away&mdash;a
tiny cloud away over on the horizon. Why school
hadn&rsquo;t even ended for the summer as yet. Jim went
up to where Ticktock stood, still tied to the orchard
fence. He stroked the mustang&rsquo;s head and told him
the good news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all set, Ticktock. You can stay. We&rsquo;ve got
the whole summer together. You&rsquo;re going to get fat
and really like it here. Now don&rsquo;t mind if Dad
doesn&rsquo;t seem to like you. He&rsquo;s really an awful nice
Dad. It&rsquo;s just that grown-ups don&rsquo;t understand a lot
of things. You sorta have to make allowances for
them. We&rsquo;ll show everybody what a good horse you
are. Only if we&rsquo;re going to make a good impression
you can&rsquo;t go around biting people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mustang took the good news very calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, old boy; I&rsquo;ll show you your new stall.
It might rain tonight and we don&rsquo;t want you to
catch cold.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c3"><br />Chapter Three
<br />The First Victory</h2>
<p>The next few weeks were busy ones for Jim.
School took most of the day, while after school
there were chores to do. Since Mr. Meadows
maintained his hostile attitude toward the mustang,
Jim was very careful not to shirk any of his farm
work in order to spend additional time on Ticktock.
In spite of the full schedule, he managed to spend an
hour or two on his pony each day. He went over the
pony&rsquo;s coat for an exhausting hour every evening
and worked on the matted tail and mane. A few
applications of methylene blue to the saddle sores
caused them to start healing, while the remaining
lameness quickly disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>The first week-end Jim laboriously put in an entire
new floor in Ticktock&rsquo;s stall. He carried fresh
clay from a hill on the other side of the farm and
packed it firmly over the floor of the stall. He kept
the pony&rsquo;s quarters scrupulously clean and filled with
fresh straw for bedding.</p>
<p>While Jim was at school, the little horse cropped
busily at the spring grass and waited for his master&rsquo;s
return. He sensed that Jim was the only member
of the family who was ready to lavish affection
on him. Mr. Meadows&rsquo; hostility was quite open and
apparent. Jim&rsquo;s mother, while at least neutral, was
seldom seen by the horse. As for Jean, Ticktock
hadn&rsquo;t quite made up his mind. Jim&rsquo;s little sister
hadn&rsquo;t decided whether to be scornful of the horse
or to like him as she did all the other animals around
the farm.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances it was not strange that
the mustang welcomed Jim home from school each
afternoon, particularly since the reunion usually
meant an apple. The little pony had never had anyone
really love him before and he was quick to respond.
Like most horses, the mustang had always
wanted to be close friends with some man. While the
cow hands on the range had treated him well, no
one had ever singled him out for any particular
attention. He had been roped, saddled and worked.
That was the beginning and end of his ranch existence.
Perhaps his very gentleness had kept him from
notice, as many cowboys preferred a rather wild and
unmanageable horse. Ticktock didn&rsquo;t lack spirit. He
simply didn&rsquo;t see any sense in bucking and kicking
up a fuss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>It was three days before Jim ventured to ride his
horse. He examined the saddle sores and decided
they were not too tender and that he could avoid
sitting on them. He put on the bridle for the first
time and led Ticktock up beside a small platform by
the feed shed. Gingerly he climbed on the pony&rsquo;s bare
back. Mrs. Meadows, unobserved, watched nervously
from the kitchen window. Secretly she thought the
mustang looked somewhat mean-tempered, but she
kept silent. Her fears were unfounded, for the pony
stood calmly while Jim climbed awkwardly on his
back. The horse craned his head around as if to make
certain his rider was firmly seated and then stood
waiting for orders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Jim sat puzzled for a moment. He had ridden
their broad-backed farm horses many times, but this
was different. He had heard somewhere you never
clicked to a saddle horse&mdash;and he wanted to do things
right. You said &ldquo;giddap&rdquo; to a work horse, but that
sounded a little undignified for a Western ranch
horse. Finally he just pressed with his knees, lifted
the reins and said: &ldquo;O.K., Ticktock, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; The
pony seemed to understand, for he started off at a
brisk walk. Once outside the yard gate, Jim gave
another press of the knees and they were off at a
trot. It wasn&rsquo;t a very comfortable trot, as jolting
along bareback on a spine as prominent as Ticktock&rsquo;s
still was, couldn&rsquo;t possibly be anything but
painful. But Jim enjoyed every moment. As he was
still being careful of the pony&rsquo;s tender foot, he rode
him only a short distance down the road. The return
trip was made at a full gallop. Ticktock was not
slow, so the horse and rider made a triumphant
entry into the yard.</p>
<p>As Jim slid off there was no doubt in his mind
that Ticktock was the fastest as well as the finest
horse in the world.</p>
<p>After the first trial, Jim went for a daily ride,
each one growing longer. He led the horse into the
yard, took the bridle over to the platform, gave a
shrill whistle, and Ticktock would trot up to be
bridled and mounted. Then they would go dashing
off down the road, chasing rustlers, carrying the
mail, or acting out whatever happened to be the
current daydream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Springdale no longer held any fascination for
Jim. Saturdays were too precious to be wasted in
town. There were too many odd jobs to be done. He
repaired Ticktock&rsquo;s feedbox, and built a rack for a
bucket in one corner of the stall. He wasn&rsquo;t going
to ask anyone to water his horse when he was away,
and he had no intention of letting the pony be
thirsty.</p>
<p>The second Saturday after Ticktock&rsquo;s arrival, Jim
was lying on the front porch resting from his labors.
He munched on a cookie and gazed contentedly at his
horse. Ticktock was in the front yard grazing. The
regular pasture didn&rsquo;t seem quite luxuriant enough
to Jim. Besides he planned to ride any moment now
and wanted his horse near. The orchard would have
been the ideal spot but the bull was again occupying
that area. The boy thought about the bull and
frowned.</p>
<p>Jim wasn&rsquo;t the only one who disliked the bull, for
Mrs. Meadows was very nervous concerning the big
red animal. She was also home this particular Saturday.
Her last words to her husband, before he and
Jean left for town, had been about the mean-tempered
bull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carl, I wish you&rsquo;d see Colonel Flesher and sell
that ugly brute. When I stay home without you
I&rsquo;m always afraid that he&rsquo;ll get loose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get rid of him this fall,&rdquo; Mr. Meadows had
said, laughing. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe enough in the orchard and
I&rsquo;m certain there&rsquo;s nothing you&rsquo;ll want in there
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim lay thinking about the time he had been
trapped in the tree. He was still angry about that
and wished he could think of some way of evening
the score. Besides, that orchard would certainly make
a nice private pasture for the horse. Grazing in the
yard was not too satisfactory. His mother had objected
at first on the grounds that Ticktock would
eat or trample her flowers. They had finally compromised
by agreeing that the mustang could graze
on the strip between the drive and the orchard fence.
As Jim disliked tethering his horse, he had to watch
carefully; but it was worth it. The pony was near
and each mouthful he ate was that much less lawn
to be mowed.</p>
<p>Jim was turning over the weighty problem of
whether to go for a ride now or to try arguing his
mother out of another cookie, when he noticed the
bull coming through the orchard gate. Either the
gate had been insecurely fastened or else the latch
had been broken. He jumped to his feet in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, the bull&rsquo;s loose!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>His mother came through the door onto the porch
just as Jim started down the steps. She made a
frantic grab and caught her son by his overall suspenders.
She pulled him, kicking and struggling,
back to the center of the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ticktock is in the yard,&rdquo; pointed out Jim, almost
beside himself with fear for his precious
horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bull won&rsquo;t bother a horse,&rdquo; Jim&rsquo;s mother
reassured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will too!&rdquo; cried Jim. &ldquo;I saw a movie of a bull-fight
and bulls sometimes kill horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, you are staying right here,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Meadows firmly. &ldquo;If anybody gets hurt, it is
not going to be you. Besides, Ticktock is a ranch
pony. He can take care of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bull took a long curious look at the mustang
who continued to graze peacefully. Ordinarily the
bull stayed clear of the large work horses but the
pony looked small enough to intimidate. He gave several
snorts and began to paw with his front foot.
Ticktock just went on grazing, ignoring the bull
completely. The big animal lowered his head and
prepared to rush. Jim squirmed and struggled in
another attempt to get free but his mother now
had him by the arm and showed no intention of
letting him go. Jim wasn&rsquo;t quite certain what he
could do if he were free. All he could think of was
that his pony was in danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to rush!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t stop him,&rdquo; said his mother. She
too began to wonder about the mustang&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>The bull lunged forward, gathering speed as he
went. His short legs worked furiously, like pistons
in a racing engine. Just as he seemed certain to
smash into the pony&rsquo;s side, Ticktock jerked his head
up and made a quick wheeling movement. The bull
rushed past harmlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Mrs. Meadows, with a huge sigh
of relief. &ldquo;Ticktock can take care of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s too smart for an old bull,&rdquo; said Jim
with more confidence than he really felt.</p>
<p>The bull turned around and was pawing again.
After his experience in the orchard, Jim was well
acquainted with the ugly animal&rsquo;s tactics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Ticktock!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>The mustang needed no warning. He was watching
the bull with a quizzical look. He seemed amazed,
as if he couldn&rsquo;t quite believe that a &ldquo;cow critter&rdquo;
could possibly be stupid enough to try any tricks on
a smart ranch pony like himself. He cocked his head
and stood waiting as if he were saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just
wait and see if this is really true. Maybe I just
imagined that bull was rushing at me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<div class="img" id="p46">
<img src="images/p46.jpg" alt="Bull and pony fighting" width="500" height="287" />
</div>
<p>The bull rushed all right. He came ploughing
across the yard like a freight train, the driving
hooves taking huge chunks out of the smooth green
sod. Ticktock calmly and neatly side-stepped. He decided
this time that he hadn&rsquo;t been mistaken. The
bull was actually trying to scare <i>him</i>. The whole
thing was ridiculous. As the bull came charging
back the third time the pony decided he had enough
of such foolishness. He wheeled sharply when the
animal was a few feet away. As the bull roared past,
Ticktock lashed out sharply with both hind feet.
Running the open range as a colt had taught the
mustang how to use his only weapons, his feet. He
had learned well, as the bull now discovered. Ticktock
planted a firm kick squarely on the fat side
of the big red animal. The bull, almost knocked over
by the force of the blow, gave a loud bellow of pain
and surprise. Jim jumped up and down on the front
porch, cheering as if at a boxing match.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sock him, Ticktock; let him have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By now Ticktock had his ears back and his teeth
bared. He stood watching the bull, willing to give
him another lesson. The bull, however, needed no
more instruction. He promptly dropped all ideas
regarding the little pony, moving a respectful distance
away. Snorting in baffled rage and disappointment,
he walked across the yard and began
pawing furiously in the flower beds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My flowers,&rdquo; moaned Mrs. Meadows. &ldquo;Now I
know that bull is going to be sold. I could kill him
with my bare hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll chase him out,&rdquo; volunteered Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t. You are still staying here,&rdquo; insisted
Jim&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>Jim gave a whistle. &ldquo;Come here, Ticktock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mustang trotted up to the porch. Jim climbed
on confidently. He had no bridle but he was long
since past the point where he needed reins to make
his wishes known to the pony. He rode over to the
nearest tree and broke off a substantial switch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, boy; after the bull.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Ticktock went after the big animal. Cutting steers
out of herds, chasing back strays, and all such maneuvers
were old routine with him. He needed few
directions; all he required was to know where Jim
wanted the bull to go. They turned the animal back
and, after a few trys, chased him through the orchard
gate.</p>
<p>Once inside, Jim gave the defeated and lumbering
bull a triumphant swat with his switch. The big
beast broke into a reluctant run. Shouting and
waving his arms like a wild cowboy, Jim chased the
vanquished bull to the far end of the orchard.</p>
<p>When finally there was no place farther to go,
he relented. Returning, he fastened the gate securely
and slid off Ticktock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the bravest and smartest horse in the
world, Ticktock. I&rsquo;m going to get you something for
a reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim swaggered into the kitchen, trying to walk
as he thought a bow-legged cowboy would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ticktock is really a smart horse, isn&rsquo;t he, Mom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to be very intelligent,&rdquo; admitted his
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can handle that bull all right,&rdquo; boasted Jim.
&ldquo;Why we can chase him all over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed you did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meadows dryly. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t say he didn&rsquo;t deserve it this time, but don&rsquo;t
make a practice of chasing him. That bull is going
to be sold and there is no use running the fat off
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, we won&rsquo;t run him,&rdquo; protested Jim. &ldquo;But
any time you want him handled, just call on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; laughed his mother. &ldquo;Now go get the
apple you were planning on asking for. And you can
have a cookie for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One down,&rdquo; said Jim as he gave Ticktock his
apple. &ldquo;Mom&rsquo;s all for you. We&rsquo;ll show the others too.
You wait. If only you hadn&rsquo;t taken that bite at
Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mustang stopped munching long enough to
grin.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><br />Chapter Four
<br />New Allies</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>By the time school was over for the summer,
Ticktock had filled out considerably. His hip
bones no longer appeared as if they were
about to poke through his hide, his neck was less
scrawny, and his backbone, though visible, no longer
resembled the ridgepole of a tent. Jim could ride
him bareback without the painful discomfort of the
first few weeks. While the daily grooming had improved
the pony&rsquo;s coat a good deal, there were still
patches that were far from satisfactory. Over all,
the horse presented a rather mottled appearance.
As some of the snarls in the pony&rsquo;s tail proved too
much for Jim&rsquo;s patience, they had been removed by
means of scissors. The result was rather weird&mdash;some
strands were long and flowing while others
were short and ragged. The mane was likewise irregular.
Jim couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to clip the mane
short, as all the cowboys&rsquo; horses he had ever seen
in the movies had long manes. So again he had
clipped where he couldn&rsquo;t untangle, ending up with
a mane that resembled a comb with half the teeth
missing. But at any rate the horse was free of
burrs.</p>
<p>There was no questioning the mustang&rsquo;s health or
vitality. He frisked about like a colt, showing that
his wiry constitution hadn&rsquo;t suffered permanently
from his past mistreatment. Since to Jim the horse
had appeared beautiful in his original state, by
now he was the embodiment of all that was perfect
in horseflesh. Ticktock ran to meet the boy each time
he appeared, even though it might be ten times a
day. It had become second nature to obey the boy&rsquo;s
whistle. The two were on a perfect basis of friendship
and understanding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>A few days after the summer vacation began, Jim
hung on the orchard fence, deep in thought. The summer
was just beginning, but he hadn&rsquo;t forgotten his
father&rsquo;s decision the night he had traded for Ticktock.
Fall had to come someday and then the mustang
would have to go. Mr. Meadows had shown
no signs of relenting toward the pony. He ignored
the mustang as much as possible and when he did
have to notice the pony, his eyes contained as much
dislike as ever.</p>
<p>Something had to be done, decided Jim. Perhaps
he could think of some way to earn money. If he
could get enough money to pay for Ticktock&rsquo;s feed
for the winter, his father&rsquo;s chief objection would be
overcome. Then with his mother on his side, Jim
felt he might win a reprieve for his horse. He thought
over the possible ways of earning money. There
weren&rsquo;t many jobs a boy could do on a farm that
brought in cash. Certainly there was plenty of work,
but you did that anyway and didn&rsquo;t expect pay. Now
a boy in town could deliver papers, cut the neighbors&rsquo;
lawns and run errands. Here on the farm it
was different. Of course you could pick wild blackberries
and huckleberries and sell them, but it would
be some time before either were ripe and he couldn&rsquo;t
afford to wait. No, things were tough. Now he knew
why boys left the farm. Feeling discouraged he went
into the house to see if there was something to eat
that would take his mind off his troubles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meadows, as her son ambled
into the kitchen, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get that cake I promised.
I forgot to get any vanilla extract when I was
in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said Jim disappointedly. Things certainly
were tough. He sat thinking a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Mom,&rdquo; he said brightening, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just ride
into town and get the extract. It won&rsquo;t take long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Meadows looked at her son&rsquo;s eager face for
a moment and then gave her permission. &ldquo;All right.
But you be careful of the cars when you get in town.
Motorists don&rsquo;t expect cowboys on mustangs to ride
through the streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else you need at the store?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to carry anything? You have
to have your hands free for the reins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a burlap bag, put the things in it and
then hang it across Ticktock&rsquo;s back,&rdquo; said Jim with
decision. At least if this errand didn&rsquo;t earn any
money it would prove to his mother that Ticktock
was useful. And then a cake wasn&rsquo;t to be sneezed at.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Jim and Ticktock jogged contentedly into town,
enjoying the warm sunshine. Arriving at the town&rsquo;s
sleepy main street, Jim looked around thoughtfully.
Where would he tie Ticktock while he was in Mr.
Higgins&rsquo; grocery store? Hitching posts had long since
vanished in Springdale. Finally he spied a fire plug.
Sliding off the pony&rsquo;s back, he looped the reins over
the plug. Perfect, he decided. He could use the fire
plug to climb back up on Ticktock when he returned.</p>
<p>Mrs. Meadows had made quite a list of groceries,
so Jim was gone some time. Also he made no effort
to hurry away from the store, as it was his first
visit to town since he had acquired Ticktock. He
stood by the coffee grinder and inhaled the wonderful
odor of freshly ground coffee while Mr. Higgins
served the two customers ahead of him. Finally he
got his groceries, carefully stowing them in the burlap
bag so the weight would be equally distributed
between the two ends. He tied the bag but stuck
the bottle of extract in his shirt pocket for greater
safety.</p>
<p>Carrying the bag of groceries over his shoulder,
Jim returned to his steed. The town constable, his
star shining brightly on his blue denim shirt, was
standing by the fire plug eyeing the mustang with
angry disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This your horse?&rdquo; the constable asked as Jim
approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure is,&rdquo; said Jim proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean tying him to a fire plug?&rdquo;
demanded Constable Whittaker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find any other place to tie him,&rdquo; explained
Jim reasonably.</p>
<p>Robert Morgan, the younger of Springdale&rsquo;s two
lawyers, came strolling by at this moment. He
stopped to listen to the conversation and to examine
Jim&rsquo;s horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t tie him to a fire plug,&rdquo; said the
constable. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will I tie him?&rdquo; asked Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in town
on business and I&rsquo;ve gotta leave my horse somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;ll tie him, but fire plugs
are out. Why I could throw you in jail for this.&rdquo;
Whittaker fingered his star, looking at Jim threateningly.</p>
<p>Jim began to be decidedly frightened. Desperately
he tried to think of something to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe you could, Whit,&rdquo; said Robert Morgan
with a grin as he entered the argument. &ldquo;I was
reading the town ordinances last night. It&rsquo;s against
the law to park a car within fifteen feet of a fire
plug but I don&rsquo;t remember a word being mentioned
about horses. You wouldn&rsquo;t have a leg to stand on
in court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean this kid can tie his nag to a fire
plug and get away with it?&rdquo; demanded the big constable
irritably.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Ticktock, in the meantime, had been watching the
argument intently. He hadn&rsquo;t cared for the way
Whittaker had glared at him during Jim&rsquo;s absence.
The horse could sense when anyone disapproved of
him and was quick to reciprocate. He had about
decided he didn&rsquo;t like the constable before any conversation
started. During the argument he kept
glancing back and forth between Jim and the huge
law officer. He had no idea what it was all about but
he could see that Jim was becoming frightened. As
it was quite plain that the constable was the cause
of all the trouble, Ticktock decided it was time to
go into action. He edged around until his hind quarters
were close to the curb and pointed in the proper
direction. After looking over his shoulder to see if
Whittaker were at the proper range, Ticktock laid
his ears back and a mean glint flickered in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; yelled Morgan. He pulled Whittaker
back just in time, as Ticktock lashed out with his
left hind leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You not only haven&rsquo;t a leg to stand on,&rdquo; said
Morgan, roaring with laughter, &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t be
able to sit down for a week if you argue with this
boy while his horse is around!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>By this time there were a dozen onlookers present,
all laughing at the embarrassed constable. The
latter, however, refused to join in the merriment.
He stood glaring at Ticktock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave that horse on the main street again
and I&rsquo;ll arrest him for being a menace to the public
health and safety,&rdquo; the constable threatened Jim
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can arrest a horse,&rdquo; pointed
out the persistent Morgan, who was enjoying himself
tormenting the law officer. &ldquo;Besides, you can&rsquo;t
quarter a horse in the town jail. It would be unsanitary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this wisecrack the bystanders became hilarious.
One man was busily jotting down notes on the
back of a letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, don&rsquo;t let me see this horse alone
on the main street,&rdquo; warned Whittaker. He strode
off, red and angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks a lot, Mister,&rdquo; said Jim to the lawyer.
He was glad the argument was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert Morgan is the name,&rdquo; said the young attorney,
extending his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to have been
of service. Any time you need any further legal advice
come to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; promised Jim seriously. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not
planning on getting into trouble if I can help it.
My father wouldn&rsquo;t like it&mdash;and then I can&rsquo;t afford
a lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are no charges,&rdquo; said Morgan laughing.
&ldquo;Just between you and me, I wouldn&rsquo;t tie your horse
to the fire plug even if it is technically legal. I just
wanted to bluff Whittaker since he was trying to
scare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; said the man who had been taking
notes. &ldquo;You can leave your horse in back of my
newspaper office whenever you want. You ride him
around there now and I&rsquo;ll show you where you can
tie him. Then I&rsquo;d like to get your name and a few
details if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim rode Ticktock around to the alley to a small
green plot in back of the newspaper building. The
editor and Robert Morgan were waiting for him
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie him to that tree,&rdquo; said the editor, &ldquo;and come
on inside for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim dismounted and followed his new friends inside.
He looked curiously at the presses and linotype
machines. He would like to have examined the machines
more carefully but the two men went directly
into a small office with the label &ldquo;Editor-in-Chief&rdquo;
written on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a chair,&rdquo; offered the editor. &ldquo;My name is
Arnold, Bill Arnold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to meet you,&rdquo; said Jim politely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jim
Meadows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I just want to get down a few facts for the
<i>Gazette</i>,&rdquo; said Arnold. &ldquo;What is your horse&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ticktock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an odd name,&rdquo; observed Arnold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I called him that because I traded my watch for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The editor seemed genuinely interested, so Jim
told him about the mustang. The boy had been longing
to find someone who really wanted to hear about
Ticktock&rsquo;s merits, so he became very enthusiastic.
He described how he had traded for the pony and
how quickly the horse had learned. Very carefully
he avoided mentioning that his father had been
angry and was not going to permit him to keep
Ticktock permanently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; said Arnold when he
had finished taking notes. &ldquo;Watch for the <i>Gazette</i>
on Thursday. Ticktock will be in it. Now I think we
all ought to adjourn to the caf&eacute; and have some ice
cream and a coke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim approved of that idea heartily, so the three
went across the street to the caf&eacute;. They joined a
tall lanky man who was seated in a booth drinking
coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Doc Cornby,&rdquo; said Arnold. &ldquo;Doc, I want
you to meet a young horseman friend of mine, Jim
Meadows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Jim,&rdquo; said Dr. Cornby gravely,
shaking hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob has just been acting as legal counsel for
Jim,&rdquo; continued the editor. &ldquo;He saved Jim&rsquo;s horse
from the law and also the law from Jim&rsquo;s horse.
For details read your local newspaper when it arrives
on the stands Thursday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc is a good man to know,&rdquo; said Morgan to Jim.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the best as well as the only veterinary in town.
If there&rsquo;s anything wrong with your horse, call on
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ticktock&rsquo;s healthy,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll remember
in case anything does happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finishing his ice cream, Jim thanked the editor
and got up to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Morgan suddenly, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hire Jim to
distribute the bills about the Co-op. He could take
them around on his horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; approved the editor. &ldquo;Do you know
the countryside pretty well, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why sure,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived here all my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we will give you a dollar and a half a day.
The idea is to deliver bills advertising the new
Farmer&rsquo;s Co-operative that we are forming. We
want to put a circular in the hands of every farmer
within a radius of ten miles. I have a big map at
my office on which we can mark out the territory.
Want the job?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I sure do,&rdquo; said Jim enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be at the office tomorrow morning at nine
or so. The circulars will be printed by then and we
can get started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim said nothing at home about his day&rsquo;s adventures,
other than to mention that he had a job for
the next few days. The following morning he hurried
through his chores, gave Ticktock a hasty
grooming, and then rushed into the house to change
into clean overalls. His mother had prepared a lunch,
which was ready for him, packed in a brown paper
bag. Jim looked inside to make certain he would
have enough. Riding all day would not ruin his
appetite. There were three thick sandwiches, two
pieces of cake and two apples. It would do, he decided
after some consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mom,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ticktock and I&rsquo;ll be
home in time for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, cowboy,&rdquo; smiled his mother. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
get lost now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get lost!&rdquo; snorted Jim indignantly. &ldquo;Why even
if I did, Ticktock would be able to find the way
back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>He went outside in high spirits, opened the orchard
gate and whistled. It was no longer an orchard
in his mind but a corral which was the private domain
of the mustang. Of course, the bull was often
there but Jim and Ticktock ignored that animal as
being beneath their notice.</p>
<p>The pony trotted over to the feed shed for his
bridle. As Jim put his paper lunch bag inside the
burlap sack, he thought longingly how handy a saddle
would be. You could tie things such as your
lunch to the saddle horn or, even better, get your
mother to make some canvas bags to fasten behind
the cantle. The way it was now, you had to have
equal weights in both ends of the burlap bag to
make it lie across the mustang&rsquo;s back. Even then it
was always sliding off. Well, decided Jim, that was
one of the problems of life. He did not have a saddle,
but he did have a wonderful horse&mdash;which was
the important thing.</p>
<p>While he was debating what to put in the bag to
balance his lunch, he realized suddenly that he had
nothing for the horse to eat. There would be plenty
of green grass and clover by the roadside, no doubt,
but they would be on the move most of the time
with few pauses for Ticktock to crop. Also a horse
needed something solid when he was on the go all
day. Feeling rather guilty, Jim went to the corn-crib
and picked out six choice ears of corn. He would
tell his father that night, he decided. After the remark
Mr. Meadows had made about having no feed
to waste on Ticktock, Jim felt rather underhanded
in giving the pony any grain. He would offer to pay
for the corn, now that he was earning money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>The Springdale <i>Gazette</i> was being run through
the presses when Jim arrived in town. He hung
around the shop watching the machinery with absorption.
The inky smell and the activity of the
print shop fascinated him. It must be fun to write
things and then see your words appear in print.
When Bill Arnold finally found a free minute and
motioned for Jim to follow him into the office, the
boy went with reluctance. Perhaps he could manage
to be both an editor and a rancher when he grew
older.</p>
<p>The editor and Jim went over the area to be covered.
Arnold outlined the region on a huge county
map which hung on the office wall. Jim made a rough
sketch, took a huge bundle of bills and started off
to work. As he jogged out of town with the bills in
two bundles hanging over Ticktock&rsquo;s back, he again
found himself longing for the convenience of a
saddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>It was pleasant riding in the warm June sun along
the country roads. There were flowers by the roadside,
the fields were a bright green, and the air was
filled with the heady scent of the rich earth and its
new blanket of growing life. Birds sang in the trees
while quail scurried across the road or took off in
their short plummeting flights. Jim felt like taking
off his shoes and wiggling his bare toes in the fertile
ground.</p>
<p>It was fun delivering the bills. He and Ticktock
developed a system after the first few farms. They
would jog along at a comfortable easy pace until
they reached the lane leading from the road. Then
they would break into a mad gallop, dashing into
the farmyard as if on a mission of life and death.
Most of the men were in the fields working, but
such tactics invariably brought at least the woman
of the house out on the porch to learn the cause of
the excitement. If there were any children present,
they crowded around to stare at Jim and Ticktock.
Jim felt proud and important, particularly if there
were boys about his age. He would hand his circular
to the woman with a flourish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure to read that carefully,&rdquo; he told each one.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>He was usually able to deliver the bill to someone
without dismounting. After he made his short speech,
he would wheel Ticktock quickly and gallop furiously
out the lane, knowing that the envious eyes
of the children were following him. As soon as they
were well out of sight, Ticktock would lapse into a
pleasant ambling walk until they reached the next
farm. The mustang seemed to enjoy the game as
much as his master. Each time he resumed his walk
after a spectacular delivery he would turn his head
around to grin at Jim as if saying, &ldquo;We certainly
put on a show that time, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="p64">

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>The first day passed rapidly. The second morning
Jim was stiff from riding all the previous day, but
the soreness soon wore off. Noon found the two near
Briggs Woods, a heavily wooded area about six
miles from home. Jim&rsquo;s route was such that the
shortest way took him along the one road leading
through the center of the forest. It was lonely and
silent once the high trees closed behind him, but the
semi-gloom appealed to the boy. He stopped beside a
small stream in the middle of the forest to eat his
lunch. As he munched his sandwiches he could see
narrow trails which led back into the trees and
hinted of mystery and excitement. There must be
pools in the depths of the woods, decided Jim, for
the air was filled with the croaking of frogs. A turtledove
was giving its plaintive, mournful coo in
the distance and there were rustling sounds in the
underbrush that hinted of wild animals passing near
by on their mysterious errands. Jim inhaled deeply
of the odor of pine needles and moulding leaves. This
would be a secret rendezvous belonging to him and
Ticktock. When he had finished this job, they would
explore the forest together until they knew it well.
Somewhere, back up one of these little winding trails,
they would find a perfect spot for a hidden camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>After lingering so long in the woods, Jim was
late in covering the area he had mapped out for the
day. He delivered the last bill and turned Ticktock
impatiently in the direction which he thought home
to be. After going several miles, he not only recognized
no landmarks, but the farms looked increasingly
unfamiliar. He stopped and puzzled over his
map. That didn&rsquo;t help a great deal. He made a
grimace and unsuccessfully tried to figure out his
bearings from the rapidly setting sun. Very crestfallen,
he had to admit that he was lost.</p>
<p>Knowing that he could stop in at any farmhouse
and ask directions, Jim was not worried. However,
he felt that to do so was to admit defeat. He and
Ticktock were a self-reliant team, and it would hurt
his pride to admit that they couldn&rsquo;t handle any
situation. Also he knew these Missouri farm women.
They were kind&mdash;too kind to suit his purposes. They
would give him very complete directions and then
insist that he have something to eat. That would be
fine, for he certainly was hungry, but matters
wouldn&rsquo;t stop there. They would promptly call his
parents to keep them from worrying. That was the
last thing Jim wanted. Not only had he boasted to
his mother about not getting lost, but both she and
his father might forbid his delivering circulars again
the following day if they were afraid of his losing
his way. No, there had to be a better way out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Ticktock looked around at his rider with a question
in his eyes. He was hungry too and couldn&rsquo;t
quite understand what they were waiting for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., boy,&rdquo; said Jim suddenly. &ldquo;You figure it
out. Take us home.&rdquo; He let the reins go loose.</p>
<p>Ticktock set out confidently at a brisk trot. He
turned right at the first corner without hesitation.
He was going somewhere, there was no doubt of
that. Jim hoped that it was in the right direction.
After three or four miles, Jim&rsquo;s confidence in Ticktock
was justified, for the countryside began to look
familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the smartest horse in the world,&rdquo; said
Jim, patting Ticktock fondly on the neck. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing we can&rsquo;t do. We&rsquo;ll really explore that woods
now. At least <i>you</i> won&rsquo;t get lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Meadows was reading the <i>Gazette</i> when Jim
arrived. The boy rushed in the house full of the news
of this fresh evidence of the mustang&rsquo;s brilliance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be late to help with the chores,&rdquo;
he explained, &ldquo;but after I got ready to come home I
was all twisted up in my directions and was going
to ask the way, but instead I just let Ticktock go and
he brought us right home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to admit that nag seems to have a sense
of responsibility where you are concerned,&rdquo; said
Mr. Meadows dryly. &ldquo;But where others are involved
he seems to have a streak of meanness. I warn you
to watch him closely, because if he causes any trouble,
away he goes. Here, read this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these ominous words Mr. Meadows handed
Jim the <i>Gazette</i>, pointing to an article on the front
page. Puzzled, Jim started to read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="tbcenter"><span class="large">Law Tangles with Horse</span></p>
<p>Constable Whittaker came out second best
in an encounter with a horse last Tuesday.
Ticktock, a fiery mustang from the far West,
was peacefully standing on Main Street
while his master, Mr. Jim Meadows, was engaged
in business in Higgins&rsquo; grocery store.
Constable Whittaker appeared on the scene
and threatened to arrest the horse for being
illegally parked in front of a fire plug. The
horse, refusing to comment without benefit
of legal counsel, stood his ground. Mr.
Robert Morgan, of Springdale legal fame,
learning that one of his clients was in
trouble, rushed to the scene. He arrived at
the same time as Mr. Meadows, the horse&rsquo;s
owner.</p>
<p>A long legal discussion ensued as to
whether or not it is unlawful to park a
horse by a fire plug. Ticktock, becoming
tired of the argument, decided to settle the
issue by kicking Constable Whittaker out
of town. Our worthy law officer was saved
from this painful fate by the heroic efforts
of Mr. Morgan, who not only wanted to protect
Constable Whittaker from injury but
wished to prevent the question of assault
and battery from entering an already involved
case. The constable threatened to
arrest the horse as a menace to public safety
but further thought convinced him that the
doughty mustang would doubtless kick his
way out of jail in short order.</p>
<p>The whole matter was settled out of court.
The Springdale <i>Gazette</i>, with its usual public
spirited policy, has placed the yard in
back of the <i>Gazette</i> building at the disposal
of Mr. Meadows and his horse whenever
they are in town. Citizens may often
see the mustang peacefully grazing there
these days. Ticktock is very friendly and
welcomes visitors, but they are warned to
make no slurring remarks or threatening
gestures toward Mr. Meadows, as the horse
is quick to take offense where his master is
concerned.</p>

<br />The Pony Express</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>It took three more days to complete the delivery
of circulars. On the last day, Jim had covered
the remaining area by mid-afternoon and was
on his way home when he noticed a farm that he had
missed. It was a dilapidated old place with tumble-down
fences and a few rickety unpainted buildings
situated well back from the road, almost hidden in
a clump of trees. The whole farm looked so neglected
and run-down that Jim decided to deliver a circular
there for the chief purpose of obtaining a closer look
at the place.</p>
<p>After riding up a long, weed-choked lane, he
reached the farmyard. It was a barren, grassless
yard, littered with odds and ends of farm machinery
and an old model-T Ford touring car with no top.
Seated beneath a huge tree was a white haired old
man, drinking lemonade. A pair of bright blue eyes
looked quizzically at Jim from beneath shaggy white
brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, son,&rdquo; he said, the leathery old face
wrinkling into a friendly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do,&rdquo; answered Jim politely. &ldquo;Here
is a circular all about the new Farmer&rsquo;s Co-operative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he leaned down to hand the paper to the old
man, his eyes rested longingly on the pitcher of
lemonade. The look did not escape the bright blue
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light a while and have a glass,&rdquo; the old man
invited.</p>
<p>Jim promptly accepted, sliding from Ticktock&rsquo;s
back. His host looked at the circular casually and
then stuffed it in his pocket. He examined Jim and
the mustang much more closely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right pert-looking horse you got there, son,&rdquo; he
observed finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smartest horse in the country,&rdquo; boasted Jim.
&ldquo;He can do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo; asked the man. &ldquo;Reckon he could catch
that shoat over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked in the direction of the pointing finger.
A small black and white pig was wandering loose
around the yard, stopping to root in the earth here
and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon so,&rdquo; answered Jim. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why
a horse would be needed to catch a pig though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shows how little you know about pigs,&rdquo; said
the old man. &ldquo;That shoat is part razorback, part
snake and the rest deer as near as I can figure it out.
Leastwise you&rsquo;d think so if you tried to catch it.
Been loose three days now. Not that I mind pigs
being loose around the yard&mdash;they&rsquo;re sort of company
to an old bachelor like me. But this little thing
is the orneriest critter I ever run across. Yesterday
it went over there where those beehives are and
knocked three of them over. Today I dropped my
plug of chewin&rsquo; tobacco and hanged if that shoat
didn&rsquo;t eat it before I could lean down. It&rsquo;s started
killin&rsquo; chickens too. Nothin&rsquo; worse than a hog that
kills chickens; never did know one to be cured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s its pen?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<div class="img" id="p72">
<img src="images/p72.jpg" alt="Runaway pig" width="500" height="339" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Over there,&rdquo; said the old man, pointing to an
open gate. &ldquo;I fixed the fence so it&rsquo;ll hold if I can
ever catch the dad-blamed pig. I guess I&rsquo;m too old
to catch a pig like that. Too lazy too. I retired twenty
years ago and aside from a few chores, I been mighty
happy doin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; for years, and now this fool
shoat has to come along to upset my peace of mind.
If I don&rsquo;t catch it, I&rsquo;ll find it in my bed one of these
nights. Already found it in the kitchen once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll chase it in for you,&rdquo; said Jim, finishing his
lemonade. He got to his feet confidently.</p>
<p>Getting the pig back into the pen was not so simple
as Jim had thought. He had considerable experience
with pigs but he had never encountered one as
wily as this. He chased around the yard after the
elusive animal until he was exhausted, without so
much as getting the pig near the open gate of the
pen. Panting heavily, Jim regarded the shoat,
which in turn looked back at him with insolent
contempt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Feared you might have trouble,&rdquo; said the old
man, who had not stirred from his seat beneath the
tree, but was watching with interest. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why
I suggested the horse. Maybe you can tire out the
little wretch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accepting the suggestion, Jim mounted Ticktock.
Around and around the yard they went after the pig.
The latter showed no signs of becoming exhausted
but finally grew tired of the scene. The animal
headed through a gap in an old fence and started
across an adjoining pasture which contained a shallow
muddy pond. In the open pasture Jim and his
horse had a decided advantage. While in the cluttered
yard his speed had been retarded by having to
duck and turn, now Ticktock could open up. The
pig&rsquo;s short legs worked like mad but the horse was
always behind him. A quick turn of the shoat would
cause Ticktock to rush past, but Jim would wheel
the mustang and in a few strides they would again
be practically on top of the pig. The fleeing animal
now began to show signs of exhaustion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>In the excitement of the twisting, turning chase,
both Jim and the mustang paid little attention to
where they were going but simply kept their eyes
glued to the pig. After being left behind on another
turn, they came rushing up on the animal, to discover
suddenly that they were heading straight into
the pond. The exhausted and panicky shoat began
floundering in the mud. Jim realized the danger at
the last moment and tried to rein in Ticktock. The
mustang braced all four legs, trying to stop, but his
speed was too great. He slid forward into the slippery
mud like a sleigh, passing directly over the
bogged-down pig. As the mustang&rsquo;s hind legs cleared
the pig, they hit a particularly slippery spot and
collapsed beneath him. The pony sat down in the
shallow muddy water with a resounding smack. As
Ticktock sat, Jim slid down the sloping bare back
and in turn landed in the water. However, instead
of sitting in the soft mud, he found himself astride
the muddy and now terror-stricken pig. The animal
let out one piercing squeal after another, wiggling
and thrashing in the shallow water. Once the muddy
water had dripped from Jim&rsquo;s eyes so that he could
see what was happening, he grabbed the pig&rsquo;s ears.
He firmly retained his seat astride the squealing
animal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Jim knew that it was only a matter of minutes
before the struggling pig would wriggle free, since
the muddy creature was almost impossible to hold.
However, after all the trouble, the boy was not going
to let the captive escape if there were any way of
preventing it. The burlap bag which he had been
using for padding on Ticktock&rsquo;s back had slipped off
with him. Grabbing it, he quickly slipped the bag
over the pig&rsquo;s head. A floundering muddy struggle
ensued. Occasionally Jim was on top but just as
often it was the pig. Finally when both were about
drowned, the task was accomplished. The pig was
in the bag. Covered with mud from head to foot,
Jim dragged the bag to shore.</p>
<p>The old man, laughing uproariously, was waiting
beside the pond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did it, by gum!&rdquo; he said, when at last he
stopped laughing. &ldquo;Mighty strange method though.
Do you always catch pigs that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I caught him, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said Jim a little belligerently.
He didn&rsquo;t see much humor in the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure did,&rdquo; said the old man, still grinning.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all covered with mud and glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pig was too heavy to carry, so the old man
got a wheelbarrow in which they trundled the captured
animal back to its pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That watering tank is good and clean,&rdquo; suggested
the old man. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you jump in, clothes
and all and get some of that mud off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After enjoying himself splashing in the cool
water for a few minutes, Jim emerged much cleaner
and in a better frame of mind. He wiped the mud
off Ticktock&rsquo;s hind quarters and prepared to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, son,&rdquo; said the old man, his eyes twinkling.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s two dollars&mdash;one for catching that
pesky animal and one for the entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Jim grinned and thanked his benefactor. It had
been a profitable day; although he hoped he could
sneak in the house without his mother seeing his
clothes.</p>
<p>The money earned by delivering circulars and
catching the pig proved to be only a teaser to Jim.
Now that it had been demonstrated that he and
Ticktock had the capacity to earn money together,
his ambition knew no bounds. He worried and fretted
over his inactivity. Surely there must be numerous
jobs that he and his pony could undertake. He considered
going from door to door in Springdale, offering
his services, but it seemed a tedious method
of obtaining work. Then Robert Morgan gave him
a better idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the Farmer&rsquo;s Co-operative doing?&rdquo; asked
Jim when he chanced to meet the young lawyer on
the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; said Morgan warmly. &ldquo;You did a
wonderful job delivering those bills. From what I
hear you must have been going at a mad gallop the
entire time. How did Ticktock stand the pace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just galloped while we were being watched,&rdquo;
explained Jim, with a grin. &ldquo;The rest of the time
we went at a slow walk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Smart work,&rdquo; said Morgan. &ldquo;We got a great
deal of publicity out of that. Publicity is what you
need, Jim, when you are trying to start something
new. You have to create interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim thought over the lawyer&rsquo;s words all the way
home. He was turning in the lane when he found
the solution to his problem. Going upstairs to the
privacy of his room, he began work with a pencil
and paper. After much thought and many false
starts, his writing began to take form. He labored
for several hours, hunting up words in the dictionary,
correcting his spelling, altering and revising
his sentences.</p>
<p>The following morning Jim bridled his mustang
and departed eagerly for Springdale. Arriving at
the <i>Gazette</i> building he sought out the editor. Arnold
was seated in his office relaxing; his feet up on the
desk, his swivel chair tipped back and a pipe between
his teeth. To Jim he was the picture of editorial
genius at work. Being an editor must be a
fine occupation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a scoop for you, Mr. Arnold,&rdquo; announced
the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have?&rdquo; asked the editor, picking up his feet
and a pencil from the desk at the same time. &ldquo;Have
you and that horse of yours started a riot or a
revolution?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;Something else though. I&rsquo;ve
written it up for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Arnold took the proffered pages, reading them
carefully. Jim watched the other&rsquo;s face anxiously
as he read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very creditable job of reporting for a cub,&rdquo;
said Arnold solemnly. &ldquo;There will have to be a few
minor changes. For example, you shouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;errands
run lickety-split.&rsquo; It would sound better to
use some such phrase as &lsquo;speedy messenger service.&rsquo;
You see, the <i>Gazette</i> is a dignified paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does sound better,&rdquo; agreed Jim. &ldquo;Do you
want the story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we can use it,&rdquo; answered the editor.
&ldquo;What are your rates for literary services?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can have this free. I need the publicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; offered Arnold. &ldquo;In return
for the news story, I&rsquo;ll run an advertisement
for you. Would that be satisfactory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deal then. I&rsquo;ll draw up something appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Jim rode home feeling proud and important. The
recent article about himself and Ticktock, even
though it had caused rather unfavorable comment
from his father, had made the boy hungry for fame.
When the <i>Gazette</i> arrived Jim was waiting at the
mailbox. His article was on the front page carrying
what seemed to Jim enormous block headlines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="tbcenter"><span class="large">New Business In Springdale</span></p>
<p class="center"><i>Pony Express Incorporated formed by Jim Meadows</i></p>
<p>Mr. Jim Meadows, local young business
man, has announced the formation of a new
enterprise in our community&mdash;The Pony
Express Incorporated. This business offers
a variety of services to Springdale residents.
The owners, Mr. Jim Meadows and his horse
Ticktock, will drive cattle to market, provide
speedy reliable messenger service, do
chores for farmers absent from their homes,
perform light freighting jobs (anything
moved that can be carried in a burlap bag),
or even baby sit providing no changing of
diapers is involved.</p>
<p>Mr. Meadows and his horse, who were recently
mentioned in this paper, are full and
equal partners in the new business. The
Pony Express, Inc., will use R.F.D. #2 as its
address, telephone Springdale 6207. Mr.
Meadows, the president, will take all telephone
messages, as the horse is a silent
partner. The advertisement of the Pony Express
will be found on page 3 of this issue.</p>
<p>Springdale is fortunate to be chosen as
the seat of this new enterprise. The variety
of new services offered will no doubt make
life richer and fuller for everyone. It is not
yet known whether the Springdale Rotary
Club will extend an invitation to Mr. Meadows
and Ticktock to join the organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>While the article was much changed from its
original form, and the last paragraph was entirely
new to Jim, there were still enough of the original
words remaining to make him feel that he had appeared
in print. Glowing with pride he turned to
see his advertisement. It was equally satisfactory.</p>

</div>
<p>Jim said nothing to his parents but let them discover
the article themselves. His father was first to
see the paper. He read the news item and advertisement,
grinning with amusement and pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are in business now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How did
you get all this free publicity?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wrote most of it myself,&rdquo; answered Jim frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll do all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Meadows.
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give your firm its first job. The bull seems
to be in disfavor around here. How much will you
charge to drive it to town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty cents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hired,&rdquo; said Mr. Meadows promptly. &ldquo;As
a matter of fact, I think your rates are too low. I
would have paid a dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I gave you a special discount,&rdquo; said Jim.
&ldquo;When you do business with relatives they always
expect discounts.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c6"><br />Chapter Six
<br />The Saddle</h2>
<p>Jim set out for town with the bull haltered and
trailing behind Ticktock. He would have much
preferred to drive the animal to market, but he
decided that discretion was better than playing
cowboy. If the animal got loose in the village and
caused havoc, his father would never trust him
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>The bull had learned his lesson well and plodded
meekly behind the horse. Uneventfully the little
cavalcade made its way into town, across the tracks,
and over to the stockyards. Colonel Flesher came
out of his weighing shed, which also served as his
office, and greeted Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, young man. I see the Pony Express
is delivering the male.&rdquo; He laughed so heartily
at his own pun that his enormous stomach shook
up and down.</p>
<p>Jim, who was very pleased that the colonel had
evidently read his recent publicity, grinned politely.
The bull was led onto the weighing platform and
after being weighed, was put in one of the enclosures
of the stockyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s business with the Pony Express Incorporated?&rdquo;
asked the stock buyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair,&rdquo; answered Jim. &ldquo;Of course, just starting
in business this way things are apt to be a little
slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have any trouble bringing that bull to town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; answered Jim proudly. &ldquo;Ticktock
comes from a ranch, you know, so he really knows
how to handle stock. We could drive a whole herd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;I have to admit
that I was a bit off base where that horse is
concerned. He has certainly improved since the first
time I saw him. I think I&rsquo;ll have a job for you in a
couple of days. There&rsquo;s about ten head of stock I
bought from a farmer three miles south of here.
You interested in driving them in for me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Jim confidently. &ldquo;Any time you say.
Ten head at my usual rates would be two dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite a wage for a young man,&rdquo; said the
colonel considering. &ldquo;But then there&rsquo;s the rising cost
of living and the upkeep on your horse so I suppose
that&rsquo;s fair. Anyhow its cheaper than trucking them
in. I&rsquo;ll give you a call. Probably day after tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="p84">
<img src="images/p84.jpg" alt="Leading a bull" width="500" height="250" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir. If I&rsquo;m away on business my mother
will take the message. She acts as my secretary,&rdquo;
said Jim, trying to speak casually.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>The telephone message came through as expected,
and very much excited, Jim set out. This was a job
to his liking&mdash;herding cattle like a true cowboy. He
arrived at his destination, collected the ten head of
cattle and started toward town. Driving the cattle
along the country roads was not difficult. He kept
the herd carefully to one side to avoid trouble with
passing automobiles. Now and then one of the &ldquo;critters&rdquo;
would see a tuft of grass on the opposite side
of the road and try to break away. Ticktock would
quickly demonstrate his prowess as a cow pony and
drive the offender back into line. Altogether the trip
to Springdale was accomplished without any untoward
incident.</p>
<p>As they started through the edge of town toward
the stockyards, difficulties began to develop. At the
sight of the wide inviting lawns on each side of the
street, the cattle really began to be troublesome. As
fast as one was chased back into the herd another
would stray. Jim and his pony both began to work
up a sweat. About halfway through town, the crisis
came. One stubborn old cow, taking a fancy to some
lettuce in a vegetable garden, went ambling across
the sidewalk with a determined glint in her eyes.
As Jim turned the pony after her, a steer broke
ranks and headed across a front lawn on the opposite
side of the street. It was a tough spot. You couldn&rsquo;t
chase two strays in opposite directions and herd the
remaining eight cattle, all at the same time. With
a sinking feeling that he was failing at his first big
job, Jim considered desperately what to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Leaving the reins dangling on Ticktock&rsquo;s neck,
Jim slid from the horse&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;Keep &rsquo;em herded,
Ticktock,&rdquo; he shouted, and started after the old
cow in the vegetable garden.</p>
<p>Ticktock followed his instructions remarkably
well. He seemed to sense what was wanted and
faithfully kept the remaining eight cows tightly
bunched. Shouting and waving his arms, Jim chased
the old cow from the garden before any damage was
done except a few deep hoof prints in the soft earth.
As he herded the straying animal back across the
sidewalk toward the main herd, he looked for the
stray on the opposite side of the street. Dismayed
he saw the steer was already across the well-kept
lawn and almost to an orderly flower garden which
nestled at the side of a little white bungalow.</p>
<p>Just as the frisky young bull was about to plow
into the little flower bed, a liver and white shape
came hurtling around the corner of the bungalow,
barking furiously. Ferociously, the dog went after
the steer, which turned tail and fled back toward
the street. Nipping at the steer&rsquo;s heels, the dog
chased the animal across the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, boy. Come here, old fellow,&rdquo; shouted Jim
as invitingly as he knew how. He was deeply grateful
to the dog for helping save the day, but he didn&rsquo;t
want the barking warrior to get the whole herd excited.
Then there would be serious trouble. Fortunately,
the dog was well trained and stopped his
barking, trotting obediently up to Jim. It was a
springer spaniel with beautiful markings. Jim
longed to reach down and pat his new friend&rsquo;s head
but the cattle seemed more important at the moment.
By now the herd was altogether again and
Ticktock was doing a magnificent job keeping
the cattle tightly bunched. The little mustang was
slowly circling the herd which was now at a standstill.</p>
<p>Since there was nothing available from which to
climb up on the mustang&rsquo;s back, Jim decided to walk
the remaining short distance to the stockyards.
Moreover, it would be easier to keep the cattle under
control with himself on one side and Ticktock on
the other. He started the cattle moving once more.
As they proceeded down the street, the spaniel followed.
At first, Jim tried to get the dog to return
to his home, fearing that the animal would start
barking and stampede the cattle. But the brown
and white springer seemed determined to accompany
him. He turned out to be a very competent
helper, trotting along on one side of the herd very
quietly until one of the cattle attempted to break
from the knot. Then the little dog would bark furiously
and chase the offender back into place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>With perfect teamwork such as this, the rest of
the journey was uneventful. When they arrived at the
stockyard Ticktock was on one side of the herd,
the dog on the other, and Jim walked behind. Colonel
Flesher came out of his office, watching the last
stage with open-mouthed amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly takes the prize,&rdquo; he observed
when the cattle were safely penned. &ldquo;You, that horse
and the dog all working together like clockwork. I
hope you didn&rsquo;t walk all the way to town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just the last half-mile. It was simple out on
the country road. Going through town, I figured out
this was the easy way to handle &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have to admit you did it beautifully,&rdquo;
said the stock buyer in admiration. &ldquo;I forgot to tell
you, but that little road over there west of the yards
comes in parallel to the railroad tracks. There are
no houses or yards along that. It might be a little
longer in case you have to circle town to get to it,
but it would probably be less trouble in the long
run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that next time,&rdquo; said Jim, who didn&rsquo;t
care to repeat his recent experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you pick up Doc Cornby&rsquo;s dog?&rdquo; asked
Colonel Flesher, paying Jim his two dollars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just recruited him on the way,&rdquo; said Jim
very off-handedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a mystery to me how you get these
animals to work for you so easily,&rdquo; said the colonel,
shaking his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have another job for you in
a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanking the stock buyer for the money, Jim
climbed back on his horse and whistled to the dog.
He felt it was only fair to return the spaniel to his
home after the assistance the dog had given him.
Arriving at the bungalow, Jim dismounted and
walked up to the door. His knock was answered by
a very pleasant-faced woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Cornby,&rdquo; he said politely.
&ldquo;I brought your dog back. He was helping me drive
cattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw what was happening from the window,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Cornby, smiling. &ldquo;It was a good thing
Horace was here to help you. That steer was heading
straight for my flowers. If it had ruined my
prize begonias, I would never have forgiven you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s certainly a smart dog. He was a big help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He spent the last summer on my brother&rsquo;s farm.
Bert taught him to go after the cows each evening,
so I guess he enjoys helping herd cattle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Mrs. Cornby had solved the mystery of why the
dog had helped herd so intelligently, but Jim was
slightly disappointed. He would have preferred to
think that animals instinctively knew what he
wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he likes to drive cattle, I&rsquo;d be glad to take him
along the next time I bring some in,&rdquo; volunteered
Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much, but I think not,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Cornby. &ldquo;He runs away too much as it is and
if anything happened to him the children would be
heartbroken. I suppose you&rsquo;re Jim Meadows of the
Pony Express that we have been reading about in
the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Jim proudly. A sudden
thought struck him. The editor and Dr. Cornby were
close friends. &ldquo;Would you do me a favor, Mrs.
Cornby? Don&rsquo;t let Mr. Arnold hear about the trouble
I had with the cattle. He might print it in his newspaper
and bad publicity like that could ruin my
business. I&rsquo;m going to drive cattle by a different
route after this, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Cornby laughingly promised she would remain
silent. Jim got back on his horse and headed
home for lunch. He would get a smart dog like
Horace some day, he decided. But first, before taking
on any more liabilities, he wanted to solve the
problem of keeping Ticktock permanently. Mrs.
Cornby had been nice, agreeing to keep quiet about
the incident. He was glad the steer hadn&rsquo;t ruined
her begonias, though why anyone set such a store
by ugly waxy-leaved plants like begonias, he didn&rsquo;t
know. Women are hard to understand, he decided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>After two more successful and uneventful trips
driving cattle to town, Colonel Flesher offered Jim
an additional job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to work for me Saturday
afternoons and evenings at the sales barn?&rdquo; asked
the stock buyer with a wave of his fat hand toward
the huge auction barn near the stockyards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds swell, sir,&rdquo; said Jim. He had attended
part of the auction one afternoon with his
father and had enjoyed it immensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a dollar and a half and your supper.
Since I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d consider a proposition
that didn&rsquo;t include your horse, I&rsquo;ll throw in feed for
him too,&rdquo; offered the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deal,&rdquo; said Jim, shaking hands. &ldquo;When do
I start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three o&rsquo;clock this Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anything and everything was sold at the colonel&rsquo;s
Saturday sales. There were horses, sheep, cattle,
goats, pigs and poultry auctioned off in the big barn.
The farmers who always came to town Saturday
afternoon or evening to do their shopping brought
whatever they wished to sell. You could buy garden
tools, tractors, chairs, setting hens or pianos. Anything
that was offered was put on the block and
sold to the highest bidder. There were items ranging
from fifty cents to five hundred dollars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>Each sale was as fascinating as a circus to Jim.
There was always a huge throng of people gathered
under the big roof&mdash;men, women and children from
all over the surrounding countryside. There is some
form of contagious excitement at an auction. When
the crowd surged forward to bid on some choice
item, the tenseness and excitement of the group
would grip Jim too. He would hold his breath as the
colonel skillfully maneuvered the bidding higher and
higher.</p>
<p>Jim gained a new respect for Colonel Flesher at
the auctions. He had always wondered secretly how
a man could be as fat as the stock buyer unless he
were lazy, but he changed his mind at the sales. The
big man was going from three in the afternoon,
when the sale opened, until it ended, usually about
nine in the evening. It was a mystery to Jim how the
colonel&rsquo;s voice managed to keep up its steady flow,
hour after hour. He never lost his enthusiasm
either. He would shout as jovially and interestedly
while selling a fifty-cent used ironing board as he
would over a prize cow. The auctioneer was particularly
adept at keeping the crowd in a good humor.
If the bidding were not progressing well, he
could always manage to bring up a joke or story to
get the crowd laughing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now look men,&rdquo; he might say, while selling a
used washing machine. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let this washing
machine go for a paltry ten dollars. No wonder the
divorce rate is rising. You tell a woman you love her,
and then, after you are married, you would rather
let her break her back over a washboard than spend
more than ten dollars. Now let&rsquo;s have a bid that will
show chivalry is not dead. Besides, I think with a
little bit of trouble you could hook an ice-cream
freezer to this motor. What am I bid? Fifteen, fifteen,
fifteen, sixteen, sixteen, eighteen, who&rsquo;ll make
it twenty. Twenty dollars by the man over there who
loves his wife. Twenty&mdash;twenty&mdash;going at twenty.
Going, going, gone! Sold for twenty dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the beginning Jim was baffled by the methods
used in bidding. During the first few sales he jerked
his head back and forth frantically trying to locate
the various bidders but he seldom saw more than
half of them. After a few experiences helping the
colonel upon the platform, he began to solve the mystery.
Some men would lift a finger while others
would wink an eye or use a nod of the head. Whatever
the signal, the colonel seldom missed it. He
seemed to have an uncanny knack of knowing who
was a likely bidder on each item, so that often it was
unnecessary for a bidder to announce himself as a
party to the bidding even on his initial offer. It
seemed of particular importance on expensive items,
such as large farm machinery, that the bidders maintain
secrecy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want the other bidders to know who
their competition is,&rdquo; explained the colonel to Jim.
&ldquo;Everybody knows everybody else and about how
much money he has. If a man knows who&rsquo;s bucking
him at an auction, he knows just about how high the
other fellow is willing to go. That&rsquo;s bad at a sale.
For example, if a good milk cow was being sold and
everybody knew old man Wilkins was bidding, they
might get discouraged because they know he&rsquo;s
wealthy and stubborn. On the other hand, he doesn&rsquo;t
want people to know he&rsquo;s in the race as someone
might run up the price just to spite him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim enjoyed his duties at the auction. He led out
cows and horses to be sold, handed small items to the
colonel, or even held up an occasional article for the
inspection of the crowd while Colonel Flesher sold
it. When there was an unusually large amount of
stock to be sold, part of it was kept at the stockyard
and driven over as required. Those instances were
the only times that Ticktock&rsquo;s services were needed.
However, Jim always kept the pony tied in the stock
barn during the sales. He liked the mustang close
by, and Ticktock seemed to enjoy the sale as much
as the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>There was a half-hour pause at six o&rsquo;clock while
the colonel and his helpers ate a quick supper. The
meal usually consisted of several hot dogs or hamburgers,
a piece of pie and coffee. The food was obtained
at the lunch counter just outside the main
entrance to the sales barn and was taken into the
colonel&rsquo;s office to be eaten. Jim always looked forward
to the brief meal. Not only did he like hot dogs
and hamburgers, but also he enjoyed the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That big gray horse went dirt cheap, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
the sales clerk, Carl Mason, would say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, it was a steal,&rdquo; Colonel Flesher would
agree. &ldquo;I tried my best to get the price up on that.
That tractor was way overbid though. Sold for twice
what it was worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim began to have a very shrewd idea of what
various articles were worth, ranging from mops to
gang plows.</p>
<p>At Jim&rsquo;s fourth auction, a saddle was offered for
sale. He saw it just before the sale opened, stacked
in a corner with a pile of miscellaneous household
articles. Climbing over two galvanized washtubs, he
managed to get close enough to inspect it carefully.
It was a Western saddle with a high horn and cantle.
The pommel, the cantle and the leather leg protectors
were all covered with fancy tooling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>The saddle had been used just enough to deepen
the color of the leather to a beautiful dark brown.
Nowhere was it worn, and apparently it had been
well cared for, as the leather was soft and pliable to
the touch, indicating that plenty of saddlesoap and
elbow grease had been used by the owner. It looked
just right for Ticktock. Jim gazed at the saddle with
longing and admiration. He had looked at the prices
of saddles in the Montgomery Ward and Sears catalogs
at home and knew a saddle such as that must
have cost at least a hundred dollars. Probably more,
as he had never seen a saddle with tooling such as
this one.</p>
<p>In his mind he counted his money. He had only
two dollars with him, but the total of his earnings
now amounted to nineteen dollars. The saddle
couldn&rsquo;t conceivably go for such a price as that,
he decided dismally, even if it were an off day at the
sale. Besides he didn&rsquo;t have the money with him and
the sales were always for cash. Regretfully he
stopped his minute inspection and went about his
duties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>In spite of being resigned about the saddle, Jim
made certain that he was present when it was sold.
It seemed forever before it came up on the block. For
the first time Jim took little interest in the bidding
on various other articles offered. When the saddle
was finally brought forward, he stood on the edge
of the crowd, tense with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I offered for this fine saddle?&rdquo; asked
the colonel. &ldquo;A hand-tooled saddle in fine condition.
None of your Eastern foolishness about this. It&rsquo;s a
serviceable as well as a beautiful Western job.
There&rsquo;s a good saddle blanket here that goes with it.
What am I bid? Who&rsquo;ll make me an offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim found himself criticizing the colonel&rsquo;s sales
methods for the first time. He wished the auctioneer
wouldn&rsquo;t praise the saddle in such glowing terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten dollars,&rdquo; came the first bid from somewhere
in the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an offer of ten dollars. Who&rsquo;ll make it
twelve?&rdquo; boomed the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve,&rdquo; was the answer from another quarter
of the room.</p>
<p>The bidding went to fourteen dollars and hung
there for a moment. Jim couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought
of that beautiful saddle going to someone else for a
mere fourteen dollars. He resolutely shoved his fears
about money for Ticktock&rsquo;s winter feed into the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen dollars,&rdquo; he shouted in a high voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m offered fifteen,&rdquo; said the colonel, glancing
quickly at Jim. &ldquo;Sixteen, sixteen, am I bid sixteen?&rdquo;
Someone gave the signal and the offer went to sixteen.
The auctioneer looked over at Jim questioningly.
Feeling very nervous and uncertain that he
was doing the proper thing, Jim nodded. His bid
stood only a moment until the ante was raised to
eighteen. Again the colonel looked in his direction
and Jim nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nineteen, I&rsquo;ve been offered nineteen; who&rsquo;ll make
it twenty, twenty, twenty. Twenty it is. Who&rsquo;ll make
it twenty-one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Flesher looked questioningly at Jim, who
had to shake his head sadly. He had reached the
limit of his means. The bidding went on briskly until
it reached twenty-five dollars. There it hung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five, twenty-five, who&rsquo;ll make it twenty-six?
Going, going, gone. Twenty-five dollars. Sold
to the Pony Express Incorporated for twenty-five
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim opened his mouth in astonishment. For a
moment he doubted what he had heard. He had
stopped bidding at nineteen. He didn&rsquo;t think he
had made any signal after that which the colonel
could possibly interpret as a bid. He started to shout
out a denial and then thought better. He would put
the auctioneer in a bad spot if he denied the bid. He
tried to think of some way out of the delicate situation.
The only solution was to see Colonel Flesher as
soon as he could and explain that not only had he
not bid any such sum as twenty-five dollars but that
he couldn&rsquo;t possibly pay it anyhow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>All afternoon he worried about the matter. The
sale seemed to drag on forever. Finally it was time
for supper. Jim collected his food at the lunch wagon
and headed for the auctioneer&rsquo;s office. Troubled as
he was, his appetite still remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a mistake, Colonel Flesher,&rdquo; Jim
said as the big man entered. &ldquo;I stopped bidding at
nineteen dollars on that saddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you did. My eyesight isn&rsquo;t failing yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard you say it was sold to the
Pony Express at twenty-five dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I got to thinking how nice that
saddle would be for your horse. It&rsquo;s worth seventy-five
dollars easily. I looked over at Ticktock and he
seemed interested in it too. After you finished bidding
I got three separate and distinct winks from
your horse. Since I understand he&rsquo;s a full partner of
the firm I considered his bids binding and sold him
the saddle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Jim was still too troubled to worry whether the
colonel was kidding him or not. He wouldn&rsquo;t put it
past Ticktock to have winked at the auctioneer. The
idea that the mustang might bid on the saddle
didn&rsquo;t seem at all absurd to Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have only nineteen dollars,&rdquo; he protested
weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly all right,&rdquo; said the colonel jovially.
&ldquo;This is one exception we&rsquo;ll make to the rule of cash
on the barrel head. I&rsquo;ve already paid for the saddle.
I&rsquo;ll take it out of your wages. Now quit worrying
about the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim quit worrying. He gulped down his piece of
pie, thanked the colonel, and rushed out of the sales
barn. He found his newly acquired saddle and blanket.
He stroked the leather fondly. It certainly was
a beauty. Tenderly he carried it over to show Ticktock.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><br />Chapter Seven
<br />Horace</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Ticktock was becoming sleek and fat by the
end of June. Decked out in his handsome new
saddle he was enough to fill Jim with a reasonable
pride and all the other boys with envy. Mrs.
Meadows made two sturdy saddlebags of canvas
which Jim had fitted out with straps and buckles at
the harness-maker. The completed outfit cost him a
dollar and a half, which he hated to spend from his
slowly accumulating hoard of feed money, but he
felt the saddlebags were a necessary part of his
business equipment. He also squandered three dollars
on a poncho which he felt any self-respecting
cowboy should own. Besides, who could tell when it
would rain and a poncho be vitally needed?</p>
<p>With his poncho rolled in a tight bundle behind
the saddle, and his saddlebags securely in place,
Jim often rode into town. Whether he was going on
an errand for his mother or to work at the sales
barn, he always arranged his route so that he rode
through part of the residential district. The boys
who lived in town and attended the Springdale School
always took an infuriatingly condescending attitude
toward the pupils of a tiny country school such as
the one Jim attended. Their manner clearly indicated
that they thought boys such as Jim were country
bumpkins. Jim felt it his duty to enlighten these
Springdale boys as to the advantages of living in
the country. While he wouldn&rsquo;t admit that he was
trying to make them jealous, he felt he should display
Ticktock and his beautiful saddle as often as
possible in order that his city acquaintances wouldn&rsquo;t
get any exaggerated ideas concerning the worth of
a shiny bicycle. Then he would be starting to Springdale
Junior High that fall and he thought he might
just as well start building up his reputation and
fame. Now and then he would stop to talk with
friends or even take a boy for a short canter. Other
times his business would be pressing so he would
gallop through the streets with a brisk clatter, fully
enjoying the envious eyes that followed him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Meadows had rather opposed Jim&rsquo;s
job at the sale at first on the ground that it kept him
out after dark. The sales often lasted until nine
o&rsquo;clock and neither of Jim&rsquo;s parents fancied his riding
home in the dark with automobiles on the road.
Jim did his best to quiet their fears by explaining
that he always rode carefully along the shoulder of
the highway where no car would possibly hit him.
However, to end the matter he was forced to add
another piece of equipment&mdash;a portable electric lantern.
He purchased a little dry-cell hand lantern that
he at first tied to his belt. After he acquired the saddle,
the light was hung on the saddle horn. He either
left the lantern turned on continuously while he was
riding or flashed it on when cars approached. He
objected to anything as modern as an electric lantern
for a cowboy, but, giving in to progress, decided
it was a very useful piece of equipment to
own. The problem of cars approaching from the rear
was solved by fastening a small round red reflector,
such as is used on automobiles, to the rear of the
cantle. He felt that added to the appearance of the
saddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Ticktock and his rider became so well known
throughout the community that Robert Morgan, the
lawyer, decided to carry out the joking suggestion
that had been made in the Springdale <i>Gazette</i> when
the Pony Express was first formed. Jim&rsquo;s name and
that of his horse were duly proposed to the Rotary
Club at one of its weekly luncheons. The members
present, falling in with the attorney&rsquo;s facetious
mood, voted unanimously to offer the two partners
of the Pony Express an honorary membership. A
few days later Jim received an important-looking
letter through the mail.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="small">SPRINGDALE ROTARY CLUB</span></p>

</div>
<div class="verse">

</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>Jim was quite excited about the letter but he was
uncertain as to what certain portions of it meant.
Particularly the word &ldquo;remunerations.&rdquo; He took the
letter to his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a member of the Rotary Club, Dad,&rdquo; he said
proudly, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t understand all of this letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Meadows read the letter over with a smile.
&ldquo;You are becoming quite famous. You&rsquo;ve been voted
an honorary member and don&rsquo;t have to pay dues as
the rest of them do. Also you are invited to a banquet
next Thursday where they want you to make
an after dinner speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that &lsquo;hazards and remunerstuff&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they would just like you to tell them about
the risks you take in your business, the profits in it,
how you like it and so on,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;You
should write a reply to this, accepting the invitation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think much
of making a speech or writing a letter either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is one of the penalties of rising in the
world,&rdquo; said Mr. Meadows dryly. &ldquo;You have more
public responsibilities. You have to make speeches,
contribute to charities and things of that nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim got a paper and pencil and after an hour&rsquo;s
labor finally composed an answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Dear Mr. Morgan:</i></p>
<p><i>Thank you for inviting me to the
Rotary Club. I will be at the hotel at 7:00 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> on
Thursday.</i></p>
<p><i>I never made a speech before but
I will tell you what I know about the Pony Express.</i></p>
<p><span class="center"><i>Sincerely yours,</i></span>
<span class="jr"><i>Jim Meadows</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next few days found Jim wishing a dozen
times that he had given some excuse and not promised
to attend the dinner. He was afraid of getting
up before all those men and talking and, what is
worse, he had not thought of a single thing to say
after two whole days&rsquo; concentration. He would go
over and over the matter in his mind and never get
beyond: &ldquo;I want to thank everybody for inviting me
to join the Rotary Club and for having me at your
banquet.&rdquo; That sounded very impressive and polite
as a starter but he couldn&rsquo;t stop there if they expected
a speech. He began to dread Thursday night.
However, he had promised, so he felt that he had
to go through with it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>When Thursday came, Jim put on his best clothes.
For the first time he found himself wishing he had
his gold watch. That watch would look very impressive
before all those business men. However, if
he hadn&rsquo;t traded off the watch, he wouldn&rsquo;t have
been in a position to be invited.</p>
<p>He rode into town feeling very nervous. Robert
Morgan and Bill Arnold met him at the newspaper
office and took him over to the hotel. Jim&rsquo;s dismay
increased when he entered the banquet room. He
looked at the big horseshoe table and decided there
must be at least fifty members. He had never seen
such a crowd before. Fortunately, he was placed between
Robert Morgan and Dr. Cornby; so he didn&rsquo;t
feel too lost among strangers.</p>
<p>Never having been at a banquet before, Jim was
uncertain whether the speeches came before, during
or after the meal. However when the standard banquet
plate of creamed chicken, peas and mashed
potatoes was set before everyone, he decided there
was little point worrying. He might get rid of the
hollow feeling in his stomach if he ate.</p>
<p>After the meal there were several short speeches
and reports about Rotary activities. Then Robert
Morgan got to his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, there has been considerable fame
achieved by a new business firm in our city. This
company has brought a new type of service to our
community. I refer to the Pony Express. While one
of the members of this organization has preferred
to stay in back of the print shop and eat grass
rather than sit with us, Mr. James Meadows, the
other partner, is here tonight and has accepted our
offer of an honorary membership. We would like Mr.
Meadows to tell us how he got started in his present
business and something about it. What is the future
of the Pony Express and does he expect competition?
Gentlemen, I present Mr. Jim Meadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim got to his feet. While the clapping was still
going on, he looked about nervously. He felt his
knees shaking, and his throat was so dry he was
certain he could never speak. Then he began to see
a few familiar faces. There was Mr. Slemak, the
buttermaker, Colonel Flesher, Mr. Higgins from the
grocery store and Bill Arnold. Everyone was smiling
in a very friendly manner. He thought about
Ticktock. Well, if everyone wanted to hear about his
horse, that was one subject he could talk about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank everyone for inviting me to
join the Rotary Club and for having me here tonight,&rdquo;
he said, going over the opening he had rehearsed
so many times. From that point on the
speech was extemporaneous. Jim just talked. &ldquo;The
way I got started in business was that I traded my
gold watch for my horse Ticktock. I guess everybody
thought I got stung on the deal except me. But I
didn&rsquo;t because I knew he was an awfully smart
horse. After I got him, I decided I had to earn some
money to feed him. There&rsquo;s a lot of overhead in my
business&mdash;feed, a saddle, saddlebags and things like
that. As for the remuner-remunera-, whatever that
word is that means profits, I guess there isn&rsquo;t much.
I&rsquo;ll be working all summer for Colonel Flesher to
pay for my saddle. I have twenty-three dollars now
in cash. That seems like a lot of money. It&rsquo;s more
than I ever had before, but I don&rsquo;t know how much
it will take to feed Ticktock all winter. I&rsquo;ll probably
end up broke. There aren&rsquo;t many hazards in my
business. I was lost once, but Ticktock found the
way home. He&rsquo;s got horse sense. Of course when he
was thin and I didn&rsquo;t have any saddle I used to get
kinda sore behind now and then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll have much competition. In the
first place, not many boys have a gold watch they
can trade for a horse. Even if they did, they couldn&rsquo;t
find as smart a horse as Ticktock. Maybe the Pony
Express has a big future ahead of it once I get my
saddle paid for. But whether I make much money
or not, it&rsquo;s sure a lot of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Jim sat down to loud and prolonged applause.
His speech was unquestionably a huge success. When
everyone had finished congratulating him on his
prowess as an orator he walked back with the
editor, Dr. Cornby and Robert Morgan to the newspaper
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks a lot for coming, Jim,&rdquo; said Morgan sincerely.
&ldquo;Your speech was the best and the frankest
that club has heard in a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim is getting to be quite a famous business
man,&rdquo; commented Arnold. &ldquo;If he were only a little
older, we&rsquo;d invite him to join our Thursday night
stag parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim said good-by and went out to his faithful
mustang. He had had an enjoyable evening and felt
rather guilty that Ticktock had such a small share
in his glory. After all the horse was a full partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you wouldn&rsquo;t have enjoyed chicken and
peas anyhow,&rdquo; he said as he mounted. &ldquo;Anyway we
got some very good publicity. Everybody knows
about us now and we should get lots of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was ten-thirty and the evening had been much
more exhausting than Jim had realized. The effort
of making a speech had been as tiring as a day&rsquo;s
hard labor and Jim felt like relaxing. Ticktock
knew the way home as well as he, so the boy let
the mustang take charge. After a short distance
the steady jog-jog of the pony&rsquo;s easy walk lulled
him to sleep. Slumping in the saddle, he dozed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<div class="img" id="p110">
<img src="images/p110.jpg" alt="Dozing in the saddle" width="500" height="206" />
</div>
<p>Everything was serene for about a quarter of a
mile, when Jim sensed something was wrong. Sleepily
he opened his eyes and tried to figure out what
was amiss. Finally he realized Ticktock had stopped
and was standing still at the edge of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Ticktock. It&rsquo;s late. Let&rsquo;s get on home,&rdquo;
he said in a drowsy voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Ticktock didn&rsquo;t move but stood looking down into
the ditch. Jim had the greatest confidence in his
horse and as he gradually became fully awake, knew
that the pony must have some reason for stopping.
Then he heard a whimpering sound in the dark.</p>
<p>Feeling a little frightened, he slipped the loop of
his lantern from the saddle horn and flashed the
light into the dark ditch beside the road. There was
a dog lying on its side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Horace!&rdquo; exclaimed Jim. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dismounting, he climbed down the bank beside
the dog and looked at him carefully. The spaniel
gazed up at him and whined piteously. Cautiously,
Jim began to feel the animal. The hind legs seemed
sound enough but when his hands touched the forelegs
the dog suddenly growled viciously and snapped
at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hurt in the front legs,&rdquo; Jim informed Ticktock.
&ldquo;I guess a car hit him and broke them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So long as Jim did not touch the injured legs,
the dog regarded him with pleading pain-filled eyes.
Jim was in a quandary. He could ride back into
town and inform Dr. Cornby that his dog was hurt
and lying beside the road. However, the dog might
be hurt internally also and minutes might be precious.
By the time he reached town and then led
the doctor back to find the dog it might be too late.
On the other hand, how would he take the dog to
town himself. The poor animal snapped at him each
time he touched the injured legs and moving him
might be the wrong thing to do. Jim&rsquo;s knowledge of
first aid was very limited but he had heard that
moving a broken limb was sometimes unwise. Horace
decided the question by looking up once more
and crying pitifully. Jim just couldn&rsquo;t leave him
there alone in the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Returning to his horse, he untied his poncho. He
carefully spread it out flat beside the helpless dog.
Then, talking gently and reassuringly, he gradually
inched the injured spaniel over onto the center of
the poncho.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be as gentle as we can,&rdquo; he told
the dog. &ldquo;If this hurts a little, it won&rsquo;t be because
we mean it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He folded the edge of the poncho under so the
dog&rsquo;s head would be clear and pulled up the corners.
By maneuvering the sides of the poncho he was able
to roll the dog onto its back very gently. Then he
tied the three free corners together. Leading Ticktock
down into the ditch, he finally managed to lift
the dog and hook the knotted corners of the poncho
over the saddle horn. He mounted very carefully
and with the dog suspended as comfortably as possible
in his makeshift sling, started the journey back
to town.</p>
<p>Jim was on his way to the veterinarian&rsquo;s home
when he remembered the words at the newspaper
office. Doctor Cornby was probably still there playing
cards, as it was before midnight. Since the doctor&rsquo;s
office was only two doors from the <i>Gazette</i>
building, Jim directed the mustang to the main
street. There were still lighted windows in the newspaper
office, so his guess proved correct.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>He left Ticktock at the curb and went up to the
front door. He found it locked, so he banged loudly.
Bill Arnold came to the door in his shirt sleeves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jim. What are you doing back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Dr. Cornby here?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, come on in. Something wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim followed Arnold back to the office. &ldquo;Your
dog&rsquo;s out here with his front legs broken,&rdquo; he announced
to the startled veterinarian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; said Cornby. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone followed Jim out to his horse where
Horace was still lying in his poncho sling. He was
lifted down tenderly and carried into Cornby&rsquo;s
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary said he ran away sometime this afternoon,&rdquo;
said the doctor, as he examined the moaning
dog. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s done that so often I didn&rsquo;t think anything
about it. Where&rsquo;d you find him, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. Ticktock found him. I had gone to sleep
and woke up when Ticktock stopped. I tried to get
him to go on, but he wouldn&rsquo;t so I flashed my light
over to see what was bothering him. There was
Horace in the ditch with his legs hurt. How is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornby straightened up from his brief examination
of the injured spaniel. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to have
any internal injuries. Of course, two broken legs are
enough, but they can be fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I didn&rsquo;t hurt his legs when I eased him
onto my poncho,&rdquo; said Jim worriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. You did a good job. I don&rsquo;t know how
to thank you for finding him. My kids would never
recover if they lost Horace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind if I use your phone?&rdquo; asked Jim.
&ldquo;Mom will be worried about my being so late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to drive you home,&rdquo; offered a stranger
who had been in the card game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim has a horse,&rdquo; said Morgan to the speaker.
&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t think of riding in a modern contraption.
Let alone leave Ticktock behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks anyhow,&rdquo; said Jim politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It begins to look as if I am going to have to
assign a reporter to follow you,&rdquo; said Arnold.
&ldquo;Wherever you and that horse go, there&rsquo;s news.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c8"><br />Chapter Eight
<br />Exile</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>The account of Jim&rsquo;s speech before the Rotary
Club and his subsequent finding of Horace
by the roadside received prominent mention
in the next issue of the Springdale <i>Gazette</i>. As usual,
Bill Arnold gave the account of both episodes with
many asides and much humor. Mr. Meadows read
the paper with amusement and considerable pride.
He had been very intrigued when the first account
and the advertisement of the Pony Express had appeared.
Now his pride in his locally famous son grew
even greater. He was well aware how hard Jim had
been working and saving and knew without question
what the purpose was behind all the industry.
With quiet satisfaction he watched his son going
out to drive cattle, run errands, or work at the
auction.</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s father was also becoming reconciled to
Ticktock. As the mustang blossomed under Jim&rsquo;s
loving care, the older man could see that he had been
rather hasty in his first judgment. Much against his
will, he had to admit, at least to himself, that Ticktock
was an unusually smart horse. Now that he
had put on some flesh he was also a rather smart-appearing
pony. In spite of all his observations,
Mr. Meadows said nothing. Like most men, he hated
to admit that he had been wrong. Also, he was reluctant
to abandon a stand that he had definitely
taken. He had said that Ticktock must go when fall
came, and he hated to eat crow. In his own mind
he resolved to say nothing further about the matter
but instead just let events take their own natural
course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>He knew Jim would never dispose of the pony
until he was forced to; so if nothing was said the
pony would simply remain by silent agreement. Mr.
Meadows knew that he would ease his son&rsquo;s mind a
great deal if he could tell the boy about his change
of heart, but somehow he never seemed to find the
right moment. After all, he decided, the worry was
doing Jim no harm but merely making him work
harder to earn money for feed. So the days went by
and nothing was said on either side about the pony&rsquo;s
fate. Jim could sense a little lessening of the hostility
on his father&rsquo;s part, but he was still worried.
Mr. Meadows seldom changed his mind when he
made a decision and thus far Jim did not want to
play his trump card about paying for Ticktock&rsquo;s
feed. However, it was still summer, and he felt
there was plenty of time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Jim made himself a lariat and began practicing.
It was a slow process but he was determined. After
about a week&rsquo;s exercise he was able to whirl an open
loop over his head. Then he began lassoing fence
posts, tree stumps, and even occasionally his sister
Jean. After several trials of the latter, however, he
had to abandon Jean as a target. She objected rather
loudly to being roped and wouldn&rsquo;t play unless Jim
let her take turns at lassoing him. Jean had been
rather lonely all summer anyhow, as Jim spent most
of his time with Ticktock instead of playing with
her as in former years. Jim would give in and let
her try roping him, but half a dozen unsuccessful
attempts would usually end with Jean hitting him
in the eye with the rope. Although he was very fond
of his young sister, he had a great deal of contempt
for women as cowboys.</p>
<div class="img" id="p118">
<img src="images/p118.jpg" alt="Lariat practice" width="500" height="224" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Ticktock watched all this practice with good-natured
scorn. He had seen experts twirling a lariat
and had no illusions about Jim&rsquo;s ability. A number
of times when Jim would fail miserably in a cast at
a fence post, Ticktock would open his jaws and give
an unmistakable horse laugh. However, he was an
indulgent horse and realized Jim was young. So,
when Jim got to the stage of attempting to lasso
from horseback, Ticktock patronizingly co&ouml;perated.</p>
<p>A dummy was constructed of bags wrapped
around a pole set in a heavy wooden base. This fake
man was set up in the drive and Jim would dash
past madly, astride Ticktock, whirling his lariat.
About one cast in four his noose would encircle the
dummy. Then the end of the lariat would be wrapped
around the saddle horn and the horse and rider
would drag their victim triumphantly down the
drive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Practicing one thing for too long a period grew
tiresome, especially when the average of success was
as low as it was with Jim&rsquo;s roping endeavors. So he
would alternate with teaching Ticktock to jump.
First a long two-by-four was laid on two bricks
about six inches from the ground. Jim would ride
up to the improvised bar at a full gallop, part of
the time swerving away or stopping, and other times
urging his horse over the bar. Ticktock caught on
to the new game in a surprisingly short time. He
was prepared to jump or swerve at the slightest sign
from his master. The bar kept creeping higher and
higher until Jim was certain his mustang could sail
over any ordinary fence.</p>
<p>Jim was feeling particularly jaunty and complacent
one morning, for he had made three perfect
casts in a row during his roping practice. After the
third cast he jumped off his horse, freed the dummy
from the noose, and carelessly set the apparatus upright
very near a small evergreen tree bordering the
drive. Remounting, he went all the way to the front
gate for his next approach. He came down the lane
at a full gallop swinging an exceptionally large
noose. As he tore past the dummy, he swung wildly.
Out of the corner of his eye he could see the loop
encircle the dummy. Jim wrapped the end of his
lariat around the saddle horn and braced himself
as if he had just roped a huge steer. It was well he
did, for unfortunately the noose caught the evergreen
also. There was a terrific tug on the lariat
and before the horse and rider could stop, half the
branches on the little evergreen had been ripped off
and were being dragged down the lane with the
dummy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Jim stopped the pony and wheeled to gaze in dismay
at the havoc he had wrought. It was a sorry-looking
tree with the upper half naked and torn.
While Jim was considering what to do next, he discovered
that he wasn&rsquo;t the only one staring at the
tree. His mother was standing on the front porch,
hands on hips, looking at the evergreen. Her face
boded no good for the cowboy and his horse. Mrs.
Meadows was very proud of her lawn and flowers.
The trim little evergreen had been one of her pet
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, what do you think you are doing
with that rope of yours?&rdquo; she demanded sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lassoing,&rdquo; said Jim humbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see. Well, there will be no more lassoing
around here if you have to practice on my trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; explained Jim. &ldquo;I was roping
the dummy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the tree got in the way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meadows,
nodding her head. &ldquo;Do you have any idea how much
it would cost to replace that tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; asked Jim hoping that it would be
some such sum as three or four dollars. He would
then offer to pay for a new tree and settle the matter.
After all, it couldn&rsquo;t be much, as there were
evergreens all over the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About twenty-five dollars; that&rsquo;s a golden
cypress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s heart sank. He couldn&rsquo;t afford such a sum
as that, so instead of being able to offer casually to
replace the damage he was forced to mumble, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t replace the tree,&rdquo; said his mother
sternly. &ldquo;From now on there will be no more roping
around here. I want you to take a book over to
Mrs. Alsop. When you come back you can go down
and help your father in the garden. Perhaps if you
are kept busy enough you won&rsquo;t be into any mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling very contrite, Jim took the book and went
riding off to the Alsop&rsquo;s. He completed his errand
and turned back toward home. His spirits began to
rise on the way back. His mother didn&rsquo;t harbor a
grudge long and luckily his father hadn&rsquo;t witnessed
the incident. He would rush down to the garden as
soon as he returned and work like mad to correct
the bad impression he had made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Mr. Meadows was busy in the garden picking
watermelons. They had an exceptionally large patch
that year, and melons were bringing high prices in
Springdale. He carefully picked the largest and ripest
and stacked them near the fence. He rapidly
collected a huge pile, all he could possibly haul to
town in one trip of the car. He had just about completed
his selection of all the ripe melons when Jim
came tearing down the lane.</p>
<p>Most of the fences were barbed wire around the
farm and too dangerous, in Jim&rsquo;s opinion, to jump
unless there were some vital reason. However, the
garden was bordered by a relatively low board fence.
It seemed the most natural thing in the world to
ride Ticktock directly to the garden and thus show
how anxious he was to help his father.</p>
<p>Unable to see what was on the other side, Jim
came sailing grandly over the fence. It was a beautiful
jump with a very inglorious landing. Ticktock
came down squarely on the center of the pile of
watermelons. Fortunately the mustang recovered
his balance and didn&rsquo;t break a leg. As it was, the
result was bad enough. Broken watermelons were
scattered far and wide, the luscious juice dripping
over the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wild Indian!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Meadows. &ldquo;Look
what you&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim could only stare in consternation. There must
have been at least a dozen melons broken and no telling
how many cracked. Numbed, he got down from
his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I didn&rsquo;t know they were there, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously. You&rsquo;ve ruined half my morning&rsquo;s
work with that crazy horse of yours,&rdquo; said his father,
the old animosity toward the mustang coming back
in his anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ticktock just jumped where I told him to,&rdquo; explained
Jim, who was anxious above all else to remove
any blame from his horse. &ldquo;It was my fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ticktock was very calm. He turned around to
survey the damage and became interested in the
broken melons. He had never looked at a melon
closely before and was intrigued. He bent his head
down and took a nibble at some of the ripe red
pulp. It tasted delicious. Curious as to just how a
melon was made, he reached out with a forefoot and
pawed one of the remaining unbroken ones. It
cracked readily, exposing the red interior. Very
pleased with himself, Ticktock took another big
nibble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you look at that!&rdquo; shouted the now enraged
Mr. Meadows. &ldquo;Not satisfied with breaking half the
pile, that fool horse has to crack another melon and
eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim hadn&rsquo;t been watching his horse too closely,
but now he grabbed Ticktock&rsquo;s reins to prevent further
damage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick some more,&rdquo; he offered. &ldquo;I came down
here to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certainly a big help,&rdquo; said his father.
&ldquo;Get that horse out of my sight. I&rsquo;ll do better without
you. There&rsquo;s been enough of this irresponsible
jumping and chasing around here. You should never
have taught him to jump in the first place. How are
you going to keep him any place when he can jump
fences?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadly Jim led his pony out of the garden gate.
It had certainly been a disastrous day. He left the
mustang tied to the orchard fence and went into the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Meadows,
looking at her son&rsquo;s face as he entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I jumped over the garden fence and landed on
the watermelons Dad was picking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s mother was still irked about her tree; so
she was not too sympathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are entirely too wild with that horse of
yours,&rdquo; she said sternly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time you stopped being
so heedless.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Jim considered this additional rebuke for a while
in silence. Everybody was angry with him and no
one cared for Ticktock, he decided. They just weren&rsquo;t
wanted any more. The only solution was to go away.
He had no idea of running away permanently, but
he felt he had to get away from his troubles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I have some sandwiches?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I want
to make a trip and get away from it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meadows, trying not to
smile at her son&rsquo;s doleful countenance. &ldquo;When do
you expect to come back from this trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you have for supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steak for one thing and apple pie for another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess my nerves will be steady enough by suppertime,&rdquo;
said Jim judiciously.</p>
<p>After he packed his lunch in his saddlebags, Jim
rode off down the road. He decided to carry out his
long delayed project of exploring Briggs Woods. He
had been so busy recently that he had forgotten his
resolve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>The quiet gloom of the woods just fitted Jim&rsquo;s
mood of black despondency. After he reached the
center of the forested area, he turned up one of the
little trails that led invitingly into the tangled
depths. He followed the first one for some distance.
It was slow going, winding in and out between the
trees, trying to keep branches from slapping him in
the face. Finally the path just faded and disappeared,
leaving him nowhere. The second and third
attempts were equally unsuccessful. Feeling that
the job of exploring was vastly overrated, Jim decided
to abandon the false trails. He struck off
through the woods, following roughly the course of
a stream. He had no fears about returning, putting
complete trust in Ticktock&rsquo;s ability to find the way
home.</p>
<p>Deep in the woods he turned from the main stream
and followed a tiny brook up an incline. Suddenly,
to his delight, he came out in a small natural clearing.
There was bright sunshine on the deep grass,
while the little stream trickled away merrily at one
end of the clearing. The open area which was almost
flat was several acres in extent. Tall trees
grew on every side, giving perfect seclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a swell hideaway,&rdquo; Jim said to his horse
excitedly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of pasture and water for
you and no one could ever find us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>He began to make plans immediately for his
secret camp. He would bring over his roping dummy
and his jumping bar. At one end of the clearing he
could build a brush hut. As he planned, his ideas
grew larger. He would make a big brush hut, big
enough for Ticktock. In front of it he would build
a fireplace where he could cook. Then, if no one at
home wanted him and Ticktock, they would come
here to live. He could cut some of the hay for the
winter. Perhaps he would also buy some grain and
store it. As for himself, he would trap and hunt for
food. Now and then he would mysteriously appear
in town with valuable furs to sell. He would buy
candy and cakes and other delicacies and then disappear
as mysteriously. People would wonder where
he lived and perhaps try to follow him, but if anyone
came too near the hide-out he would think up
some plan to scare them. Soon they would say the
woods were haunted.</p>
<p>Jim ate his lunch full of all these plans, while
Ticktock unconcernedly cropped the grass. As the
afternoon wore on, Jim decided to wait at least another
day before he became a lonely woodsman. He
would eat one more supper at home since there was
apple pie. He rode home and went in to supper with
an air of secrecy.</p>
<p>There was no crisis at home that evening; so
Jim further delayed his plan of moving. However,
the following day he did take his jumping bar and
his roping dummy to the new hide-out. He also took
a hatchet and spent the better part of several days
building a brush hut which looked very impressive,
even though the brush roof did leak. In front of it
he built his fireplace. He thought about buying some
weiners in town and holding a weiner roast, but
somehow the idea didn&rsquo;t seem too much fun alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Ticktock and he seemed to be partially forgiven
at home; so Jim stayed on. There was no use becoming
an exile if you didn&rsquo;t have to, he concluded sensibly.
Still, it seemed a pity to waste such a perfect
hideaway. He used it for roping practice and for
jumping, but it seemed there should be something
more dramatic that he could do.</p>
<p>It was hard to keep the secret of the hide-out to
himself; so Jim began to hint darkly to Jean about
his lonely spot. At first that young lady begged to
be let in on the secret. She wanted to accompany
him to his hidden headquarters and teased and
begged for several days. That suited Jim exactly,
and he went about acting mysterious and important.
However, Jean was not quite so guileless as
her brother thought. Although she was only ten, she
knew a little about handling men, her brother in
particular. She dropped her attitude of pleading and
began to scoff openly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are just making up the whole thing,&rdquo; she
said derisively. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got a secret hangout
any more than I have.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Several days of complete indifference had its effect
on Jim. He felt he had to prove his story. He
felt a bit guilty about neglecting Jean all summer
anyhow; so he planned a grand picnic. Riding to
town, he bought some weiners, marshmallows and
cookies. The rest of his supplies he secured at home
and got permission from his parents for the excursion.</p>
<p>With Jean mounted behind him, he rode to Briggs
Woods. He felt that revealing the general area of
his hangout was not giving away too much of his
secret. Once in the woods, however, he insisted on
blindfolding his sister, extracting a solemn promise
not to peek. She submitted to having a large red bandanna
tied over her eyes, even enjoying the mystery.
Jim then made his way to the hide-out, making several
unnecessary circles to confuse his companion.
When they arrived in the middle of the clearing he
whisked off the bandage.</p>
<p>Jean looked around at the little clearing expectantly.
There was nothing very exciting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s nothing but a big open space!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look what nice pasture there is for Ticktock,
with water and everything,&rdquo; explained Jim, a trifle
annoyed at the poor impression his headquarters
made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s nice enough,&rdquo; admitted Jean who
wasn&rsquo;t much interested in such details. She wanted
something smaller and much more secret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my hut and fireplace,&rdquo; said Jim pointing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; said his sister finally, feeling she
had to say something complimentary since her
brother had gone to such trouble to bring her on the
picnic.</p>
<p>They played for a time and then gathered dry
wood for a fire. After they had roasted the weiners
and marshmallows, and stuffed themselves with
cookies, Jim stretched out lazily on the grass. This
was the life. He began to daydream that he was a
cowboy who was hiding his sister from dangerous
kidnappers.</p>
<p>Jean, although she had enjoyed the day immensely,
felt that there was still something being
kept from her. In her mind a hide-out couldn&rsquo;t be
two acres of open pasture, even though it was concealed
in the middle of a wood. She suspected there
was more to the place than Jim had shown her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll walk around a little,&rdquo; she said casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., but don&rsquo;t go outside of shouting distance,&rdquo;
warned her brother in a superior tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful
easy to get lost unless you know the woods like Ticktock
and I do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>One side of the clearing was bounded by a rocky
hill which sloped up abruptly. Jean chose this side
to explore. She started climbing upward through
the rocks. After approximately half an hour went
by, Jim decided it was time that he had some word
from his sister. He was about to shout when he
heard her calling him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, guess where I am,&rdquo; she shouted</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in your hide-out, smarty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Completely puzzled Jim started toward the hillside.
He looked up at the steep rocky slope in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see you,&rdquo; he said finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; came her voice from almost over
his head.</p>
<p>Jim looked up as his sister appeared from behind
a short stunted tree about fifteen feet up the face of
what was almost a cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a wonderful cave,&rdquo; said Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; exclaimed Jim in complete astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so surprised because I found it. I
knew there was more to your hideaway than just
a big field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim found a narrow ledge that made an easy path
up to the tree. When he pulled the stumpy pine tree
to one side there was the narrow entrance to the
cave. It was a dark opening about two feet wide and
four feet high.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you found it you might as well see
the inside,&rdquo; said Jim, trying to talk casually. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
run down and get the flash light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t quite keep the excitement out of his
voice, and Jean looked after him with growing suspicion.
When he returned they made their way inside
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How big is it?&rdquo; asked Jean as she followed her
brother through the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;uh&mdash;just medium,&rdquo; answered Jim, trying
to flash his light around quickly in order to answer
the question correctly.</p>
<p>There was only one room to the cave, but it was
spacious and dry. The ceiling arched above their
heads at least twelve feet. Along one of the stone
walls there was a natural ledge at just the right
height for a bed or a seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will make a swell place,&rdquo; said Jim incautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you have ever been in here before,&rdquo;
accused Jean. &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo; hedged Jim not wanting to
tell an outright lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there another cave?&rdquo; asked Jean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of. All there was to my hide-out
I showed you. The trick is in finding your way here.
You don&rsquo;t seem to realize how important a pasture
is to a secret headquarters. A cowboy has to have
some place for his horse to graze. What good would
a cave do? You couldn&rsquo;t keep a horse in a cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather play pirate or robbers,&rdquo; decided Jean.
&ldquo;Then a cave would be perfect. You wouldn&rsquo;t need
a pasture or a horse either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they resaddled Ticktock and prepared to leave,
Jean continued her argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the hide-out should be half mine since I
discovered the cave,&rdquo; she maintained.</p>
<p>Jim pondered the question thoroughly. Jean&rsquo;s demands
did seem fair, for the cave certainly added
tremendously to the hide-out. Still, if the emergency
arose and he had to return to his original
plan of disappearing with Ticktock, he didn&rsquo;t want
Jean to know his whereabouts. A woman could
never keep a secret, and she would certainly tell her
parents. No, unfair as it seemed, he would have to
keep his headquarters to himself.</p>
<p>Protesting bitterly, Jean was blindfolded. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; she stormed.</p>
<p>Jim was firm, however, so they rode off toward
home. Since Jean felt her brother was being very
unjust, she decided she no longer had to keep her
promise not to peek. While Jim was busy keeping
the branches from hitting them in the face, she took
cautious peeps from beneath the handkerchief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />Chapter Nine
<br />The Lost Horse</h2>
<p>Business took a midsummer slump, and Jim
found time hanging heavy on his hands.
There were few calls for his services from
the general public, and even Colonel Flesher had
no cattle to be driven to market. Jim tried to persuade
the stock buyer that it would be cheaper to
drive hogs to town than to truck them. While the
colonel had much confidence in his young assistant,
he wisely concluded that driving hogs was beyond
even Jim and Ticktock.</p>
<p>Jim still went to town almost daily, partly to
exercise his mustang and partly because he liked to
hang around the newspaper office. He helped wherever
possible, but probably hindered more than he
helped, as he had so many questions. The linotype
machine fascinated him, and he begged Bill Arnold
to let him learn how to operate it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do,&rdquo; said the editor jokingly, &ldquo;the first thing
I know you&rsquo;ll have that horse in here helping you.
I&rsquo;m afraid his feet would be too heavy for the
keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need something to do,&rdquo; urged Jim. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
fierce depression in my line of business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your overhead is low though,&rdquo; pointed out Arnold.
&ldquo;That cayuse of yours is getting his feed from
my back yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Operating expenses may be low right now, but
there is a long winter ahead,&rdquo; said Jim with a worried
frown. His cash was accumulating too slowly
to suit him.</p>
<p>One day Arnold came out of his office waving a
slip of paper. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a fine opportunity for you and
that wonderful horse to show your stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A big job?&rdquo; asked Jim excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know Mr. Hernstadt?&rdquo; asked
the editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where his farm is,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;He has
all those big fat work horses.&rdquo; Any horse that didn&rsquo;t
resemble Ticktock in size and build was an object
of contempt to Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, those big fat horses are very valuable
Percherons. Hernstadt is one of the finest breeders
in the Middle West. Anyhow, his prize mare got out
of the pasture somehow and is lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work horses must be dumb,&rdquo; said Jim with conviction.
&ldquo;You could never lose Ticktock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, will you quit bragging about that
mustang long enough to listen to what I am telling
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Jim, who really wasn&rsquo;t at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This mare strayed away two days ago, and
Hernstadt has looked all over for her. Now he is
advertising, offering a reward of twenty-five dollars
for her return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five dollars!&rdquo; exclaimed Jim. &ldquo;How I&rsquo;d
like to find that horse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is scarcely ethical,&rdquo; said Arnold. &ldquo;The
paper isn&rsquo;t delivered until tomorrow; so I&rsquo;m giving
you a twenty-four-hour advantage over my other
subscribers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give you away for anything. When I
find the horse, I&rsquo;ll wait until the paper is out before
I take it back to Mr. Hernstadt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather confident, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Arnold
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it couldn&rsquo;t very well be stolen; a big horse
like that would be too easy to trace. She&rsquo;s just
strayed, and Ticktock and I will find her.&rdquo; Jim got
up decisively. &ldquo;If I can take a look at your big map,
I&rsquo;ll be on my way to locate that dumb horse that
got lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After carefully studying the map, Jim drew
a little sketch. He put Mr. Hernstadt&rsquo;s farm in
the middle and then drew in all the roads in the
surrounding territory. He mounted Ticktock and
galloped importantly out of town. It was only midmorning,
and he explored the country roads and
lanes for several hours before hunger drove him
home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have to be gone all afternoon on a very important
mission,&rdquo; he announced as he was eating
lunch.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Meadows just smiled and asked no
questions. They were used to Jim&rsquo;s acting mysterious
and important. Jean, however, followed him out
into the yard. Her curiosity was definitely aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she teased. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell
on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave a cowboy&rsquo;s word not to tell,&rdquo; said Jim
saddling Ticktock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think you&rsquo;re mean,&rdquo; said Jean. &ldquo;You
aren&rsquo;t good to me at all any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim considered this a moment as he cinched up
the saddle. He still felt a little guilty about the matter
of the hideaway. After all, Jean wouldn&rsquo;t be
going anywhere to tell anyone. The secret would be
safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big reward going to be offered tomorrow
for a lost horse,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
find him before anyone knows about the reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A prize Percheron mare of Mr. Hernstadt&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you find her, how are you going to catch her?&rdquo;
asked Jean, who was a practical young lady.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ticktock could catch any slow old Percheron,&rdquo;
said Jim scornfully. Actually he hadn&rsquo;t
thought about what he would do after locating the
missing horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean catch up <i>with</i> her. How are you
going to put a halter on her if she&rsquo;s the kind of horse
that runs away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled Jim, who had just had an idea.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of practicing with my lariat.
I think I could lasso a slow-moving horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While his admiring and envious sister gazed after
him, Jim rode away. All afternoon he jogged back
and forth, up and down the hills, carefully covering
the territory of his map. The sun was hot and the
country roads were dusty.</p>
<p>What had begun as an adventurous hunt, turned
out to be a tedious job. At sundown he turned
toward home. He was very tired and so was Ticktock.
Most of the roads were now crossed off the
map. Only a few were left unexplored.</p>
<p>That night Jim lay in bed considering the problem.
The mail would be delivered at about eleven
the next morning and then everyone would be on the
lookout for the missing mare. He would have to
work fast.</p>
<p>At breakfast the next morning Jim asked to be
excused from the remaining chores.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is this mysterious mission?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Meadows good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jean can tell you,&rdquo; said Jim who was deep in
thought as to the possible whereabouts of the stray.
They would know as soon as the paper arrived anyhow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hernstadt lost one of his Percherons. There
is going to be a reward in the morning paper and
Jim is going to find her before anyone else knows
about it,&rdquo; said Jean importantly. It never occured
to her to doubt her brother&rsquo;s abilities or success.
After all, he had said he would find the horse so
find the horse he would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is, is he?&rdquo; asked Mr. Meadows. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a map,&rdquo; said Jean who considered that a
final answer. &ldquo;After he finds her he is going to
catch her with Ticktock and then rope her. All he
has to do then is collect the reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s as simple as it sounds,&rdquo; said Mr.
Meadows. &ldquo;Anyhow, I think I can do the rest of the
chores myself while you&rsquo;re off performing this little
task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim also hoped it was as simple as it sounded. As
he rode off he wished he hadn&rsquo;t spoken so confidently
either to the editor or to Jean. He was on the spot
now. He had to find the horse. He urged Ticktock
to a faster pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Noon found the boy and his horse covered with a
blanket of dust and discouragement. The allotted
territory was exhausted and there was still no horse.
Of course, the Percheron could have strayed farther
than Jim had expected. He considered enlarging his
area. That idea didn&rsquo;t seem too promising, as by now
everyone in the countryside would know about the
reward. Feeling rather low in spirits and very hot,
he turned toward Briggs Woods. He had already
explored the road through the woods and all the
open trails, but at least it was cool there and Ticktock
could have a drink of water.</p>
<p>Once in the cool cover of the forest, Jim turned
toward his hideaway. He would take a rest there
and eat his lunch. He was picking his way moodily
through the trees when Ticktock suddenly decided
to go off toward the left. Somewhat annoyed, Jim
pulled the mustang back in the direction of the hideout.
A few minutes later the pony again veered off
to the left. This time he put his nose in the air and
neighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, boy?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<p>Ticktock stood still and neighed a second time.
This time there was an answer from the depths of
the woods. Excitedly Jim urged the pony forward,
giving him his head. Ticktock threaded his way
through the trees confidently. After a short distance
Jim suddenly saw through the woods the figure of
a big gray horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Ticktock, you found her!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>He uncoiled his lasso as he approached. He was
going to make good his boasts after all. Triumphantly
he started to swing his rope. He made two
circles around his head and the rope caught on the
limb of a tree and fell in a tangle about his shoulders.
He straightened out the lariat and tried again.
This time the noose caught on a limb and refused to
come loose. Feeling very uncowboylike, Jim dismounted,
climbed the tree, and freed his lasso.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Jim was still trying. Either
the rope would catch on a branch or the horse would
move away just as he cast. He couldn&rsquo;t use a very
large noose due to the crowding branches, and somehow
a limb always protected the mare&rsquo;s head or she
moved just in time to make the small noose whiz by
harmlessly. Being hit on the head a number of times
by a rope wasn&rsquo;t making the Percheron any more
approachable either. She was definitely getting tired
of the game and fast becoming skittish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>Ticktock watched his master&rsquo;s endeavors patiently
for a long time. He was used to Jim&rsquo;s games and at
first thought this was another form of roping practice.
Gradually, however, he began to realize that
Jim was really trying to rope the mare for some
purpose. He could sense the disappointment after
each unsuccessful try. Also, Ticktock was getting
tired of going through trees after the mare. He had
been going steadily all morning and felt like stopping.
So he decided to end all this nonsense. While
Jim was resting after a particularly strenuous cast,
Ticktock took charge. He gave a soft neigh and then
waited. The mare neighed back.</p>
<p>Ticktock turned his head around and gave a long
look at his rider. There was no mistaking his meaning.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your chance, now let me try,&rdquo; he
seemed to say. Very slowly and patiently he made
his way toward the mare. Jim sat quietly in the
saddle. Finally Ticktock stopped and stood waiting.
After a few more exchanges of nickers, the mare
walked over to the mustang and the two horses began
to rub noses. Gradually Ticktock edged around
until they were side by side. Jim reached over and
slipped one end of his rope around the mare&rsquo;s neck.
The chase was ended.</p>
<p>He led the mare back to the hideaway and tied
her to a tree. He took off Ticktock&rsquo;s saddle and the
pony rolled gratefully in the tall grass. Jim sat
down to eat his lunch, feeling very satisfied and
happy. Ticktock was certainly a smart horse; he
knew how to do everything. Now they could go back
home in triumph. That seemed even more important
than the reward. There was no question about it;
his horse had saved the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<div class="img" id="p144">
<img src="images/p144.jpg" alt="Roping a horse" width="500" height="361" />
</div>
<p>As he thought about how creditable Ticktock&rsquo;s
part had been, Jim began to grow dissatisfied with
his own performance. He had fallen down on the
roping. He couldn&rsquo;t very well go back and tell how
he had finally caught the horse. There wasn&rsquo;t anything
very dashing about that. Something had to be
done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>He got up, saddled Ticktock, and led the mare out
to the middle of the clearing. Very gently he undid
the rope from her neck, talking soothingly all the
time. While the mare contentedly cropped the grass,
Jim backed Ticktock away a few feet. He swung his
lariat quietly and slowly. He leaned forward and
when the mare looked up he cast. The noose dropped
squarely over her head.</p>
<p>With a sigh of relief, Jim rode up to the mare.
He tied a knot so the noose would not choke the
Percheron and then rode off through the trees, leading
his valuable captive.</p>
<p>Home was only slightly out of his way to the
Hernstadt farm and Jim could not resist the temptation
to display the mare. Trying to appear very
casual and unexcited, he rode up the lane. His father
had just come in from the field when he arrived; so
the entire family came out to meet him. It was a
very satisfactory entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find her?&rdquo; asked Mr. Meadows
who was plainly amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over in Briggs Woods. Ticktock found her and
I roped her,&rdquo; said Jim very calmly, but with a
twinge of conscience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and that horse continually dumfound me,&rdquo;
said Mr. Meadows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Jim went inside and telephoned Mr. Hernstadt
that his missing horse had been found. The pleased
owner offered to come over after the mare but Jim
insisted on delivering her. Before he left he called
the editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can take that ad out of the paper,&rdquo; he told
Arnold with a pardonable amount of pride in his
voice. &ldquo;I am on my way to take the mare home
right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arnold insisted on knowing a few details which
Jim gave him with pretended reluctance. After all,
as Mr. Morgan had said, what a business needs is
publicity. Besides it would look nice in the paper
about his roping the runaway horse. That would
really make the other boys&rsquo; eyes bug out.</p>
<p>When Jim delivered the horse that afternoon, Mr.
Hernstadt handed him twenty-five dollars gladly.
He listened to the account of how the horse had been
found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man that helped me take care of the horses
left a few months ago to run a farm of his own,&rdquo;
the horse breeder explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so busy that
I didn&rsquo;t notice the fence needed repairing in one
corner. That&rsquo;s how she got out. Now that you have
found the horse you don&rsquo;t suppose you could find me
a good man to help take care of her and the other
horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jim considering the matter seriously,
&ldquo;the Pony Express does all sorts of things. I&rsquo;ll see
what I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />Chapter Ten
<br />Ticktock Disappears</h2>
<p>With the twenty-five dollars reward money
added to his previous earnings, Jim now
had over fifty dollars. Fifty dollars was
more money than he had ever seen before and
seemed like the largest sum in the world. It must be
adequate, he felt, to cover the cost of Ticktock&rsquo;s feed
for the winter. Mr. Meadows had not brought up
the subject, and Jim was content to keep the unannounced
truce. His father seemed to be over his
anger about the watermelons. Jim reasoned that if
the matter of Ticktock&rsquo;s board was never mentioned,
he would be foolish to call attention to it. It was
simple arithmetic&mdash;he would be fifty dollars wealthier
if he let sleeping dogs lie. If Mr. Meadows did
raise the question, Jim was prepared. If necessary,
he figured he could even pay for Ticktock&rsquo;s keep
elsewhere, although it would have broken his heart
to have the mustang where he could not be seen and
ridden daily. Still, such a course would be better
than having to give up the pony in the fall as his
father had threatened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>All over fifty dollars Jim felt he was free to spend.
As he earned money from odd jobs, he began using
it to stock his hideaway. He bought cans of pork
and beans, sausages, corned beef, vegetables, fruits,
soups, condensed milk, and even one can of Boston
brown bread. Anything that came in cans or packages
that seemed safe from spoilage was carefully
stowed away in the cave. He was frugal about the
process, preferring to take quietly those items that
were in plentiful supply at home rather than spend
his hard-earned money.</p>
<p>For quite a while now, Jim had been allowed to
take food from the pantry for his picnics and all-day
trips without asking for specific permission,
provided there was plenty on hand of what he needed.
In case of doubt, it was understood that he ask his
mother. It was the same with anything that his
mother had piled on the left-hand side of the attic.
Both he and Jean could take anything they wished
from the accumulation there.</p>
<p>Now, therefore, to the supplies which he bought
with his own money, he added from the family cupboard
sugar, coffee, tea, salt, pepper and a small
quantity of flour. These he put carefully in jars
that he picked up. In the same manner he slowly
accumulated a set of battered pots and pans, two
plates, and a few odd knives and forks, as well
as an old blanket and a torn quilt from the
attic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>The only difference between what he did this time
and what he had done before was that he didn&rsquo;t say
a word to his mother about it all. Since always before
he had talked over his plans with her, he now
had a guilty feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep a list of everything,&rdquo; he said to himself,
&ldquo;and show it to Mother later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was so much more exciting to act mysteriously
and in secret. It made the cave a real hide-out,
something that belonged to him alone.</p>
<p>The quilt and blanket were the last items he
needed to complete his preparations. Since he
couldn&rsquo;t very well ride out of the yard with them
without causing questions, he slipped out one evening
and hid them a respectable distance down the
road. The next morning when he had finished his
work, he saddled Ticktock and rode off to recover
them. As he stopped to pick up his bedding, he was
congratulating himself on how secretly he had managed
everything. He looked under the little bush
where he had left them the previous evening but the
quilt and blanket were gone. With a puzzled frown
on his tanned face, he tried to figure out the mystery.
There was little traffic on the road past the
farm and no reason why anyone would be prompted
to stop at this spot and discover his bedding. Very
annoyed, he looked up and down the road to see if
there was any other bush he could possibly have
confused with this one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for your blankets?&rdquo; asked a teasing
voice.</p>
<p>Jim looked up, and there was his sister Jean sitting
on the opposite side of the road. She held his
missing loot in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Jim demanded, very
crestfallen at being caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing with these?&rdquo; asked Jean
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was just going to use them somewhere!&rdquo;
said Jim in confusion. He tried to think fast. &ldquo;I
thought I might go fishing and want a soft place to
lean back on while I fished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny you&rsquo;d go to all this trouble just to take
some blankets with you fishing,&rdquo; observed Jean with
mockery in her voice. &ldquo;You forgot your fish pole
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s none of your business,&rdquo; replied Jim
lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; said Jean. &ldquo;You were taking them
to the hideaway and the hideaway is part mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. Whatever gave you the idea I
was taking them there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been watching things,&rdquo; said Jean
calmly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, you&rsquo;ve got sugar, coffee, plates,
cups and two jars of peaches. Of course, I don&rsquo;t
know what you might have bought in town. Where
else would you take all that stuff except to the
cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all right, the stuff was for the cave. Now
what good does it do you to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, unless I know where the cave is. But
you&rsquo;re going to show me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either you spill the beans or I&rsquo;ll squeal.&rdquo; Jean
had read enough comic strips that she could talk
like a thug, and this was an occasion when she felt
she had to act tough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promised not to tell when I took you to the
hideaway,&rdquo; objected Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I didn&rsquo;t promise not to tell about all
this stuff you&rsquo;ve been stealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t really stealing,&rdquo; protested Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like stealing to me,&rdquo; said Jean with infuriating
calmness. &ldquo;You took a bunch of junk but
you didn&rsquo;t ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim felt trapped. He still didn&rsquo;t consider his recent
activities thievery, but that wasn&rsquo;t the important
part. If Jean talked, his parents would ask
embarrassing questions about what he had done
with the articles. They would know he had a secret
headquarters, which spoiled half the mystery. It
was better that Jean knew, than everyone. Thus far
she had kept very quiet about what she already
knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll take you there on your
birthday,&rdquo; he offered finally.</p>
<p>Jean considered thoughtfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s three weeks
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m awful busy now. Besides, wouldn&rsquo;t
it be a nice birthday present&mdash;making you a full
partner in the hideaway. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of things
there I bought at the grocery store and you can have
half of them.&rdquo; Jim hoped she would forget about the
matter in three weeks. He didn&rsquo;t expect it, but it
was a possibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, on my birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K. Give me the blankets and remember, don&rsquo;t
tell anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I won&rsquo;t, now that everything is going to be
half mine!&rdquo; said Jean with decision. &ldquo;What are you
going to do with all the stuff anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That question rather stumped Jim. He hadn&rsquo;t
gone into the reason behind all his activity in stocking
the cave. He had long ago forgotten his idea of
going there to live the life of a hermit. In the thrill
of secretly gathering a hoard of food and utensils
he hadn&rsquo;t given much thought as to the purpose of
it all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hadn&rsquo;t thought about that too much,&rdquo; he
admitted frankly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just fun to have the stuff in
the cave. I can pretend I&rsquo;m an outlaw hiding out.
Maybe Mother will let me camp out all night sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we could pretend we were shipwrecked on
an island or that we were in a war and surrounded
by enemies, and lots of things,&rdquo; suggested Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good ideas,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;Well, I better be going.
I&rsquo;ll take you there on your birthday.&rdquo; He rode off
feeling that Jean might not be such a bad partner
to share his hide-out. She was resourceful and she
had imagination. Also, there was still three weeks
in which he could enjoy the secret in solitary
splendor.</p>
<p>Jean watched her brother disappear down the
road. She had earned a victory, but three weeks was
a long time. She walked back to the house with a
very thoughtful look on her determined young face.
She had been doing much thinking and observing,
and she wasn&rsquo;t going to stop and wait calmly for
her birthday.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Jim delivered his blankets to the cave. After
gloating over his very respectable pile of provisions,
he made himself a pot of coffee. It was a lot of
trouble, and he didn&rsquo;t care too much for coffee, particularly
with a lot of grounds, as his somehow always
managed to have. Still it was fun. He washed
the pot in the stream, scouring it carefully with
sand before replacing it in the cave.</p>
<p>On his way back home he made a detour to go by
the railroad tracks. It was about time for the morning
freight to pass by, and he enjoyed watching the
long train labor slowly up a hill which was about a
mile from the farm. Arriving at a good point of
vantage near a stream at the foot of the hill, he
dismounted to sit by the roadside. Ticktock grazed
contentedly while Jim chewed on a long stem of
grass.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the train came whistling around
the bend at full speed, trying for a head start up
the hill. Jim counted the cars as they appeared, his
largest total was fifty-seven and he had hoped this
freight would break the record, for the engine slowed
and began laboring the moment it hit the upgrade.
As the sixteenth car appeared around the curve, he
forgot about counting. A figure was running along
the top of the boxcars toward the engine, looking
frantically over his shoulder every few minutes.
About ten cars later Jim saw the cause of the excitement.
A second man was pursuing the first, but
the latter did not seem particularly worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Railroad cop,&rdquo; thought Jim. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to
catch that hobo.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>The first man apparently realized that he didn&rsquo;t
have too far to run before he reached the engine.
He stopped in his flight and began clambering down
the side of one of the freight cars. The train had
slowed considerably now that it was part way up
the hill. The man looked down at the ground and
then up at the car tops where his pursuer was hidden
from view. Then he jumped. The leap occurred almost
at the point where the tracks crossed the
trestle over the stream. Jim could not tell if the man
landed on the ground or in the water. In either case,
he must be badly shaken up, for although the train
had lost much of its speed it was still traveling at
a respectable rate.</p>
<p>It was several hundred yards to the trestle, so,
deciding that it would be quicker to ride than to
walk, Jim dashed for his horse. Unfortunately,
Ticktock had strayed up the road looking for choice
bunches of clover. By the time Jim had run to his
horse, mounted, and then ridden over to the trestle,
several minutes had elapsed. Pulling Ticktock to a
dust-raising stop that would have done credit to a
Western movie, Jim slid to the ground. There was
no mangled corpse in sight. He rushed to the edge
of the bank bordering the stream and peered down.
Still there was nothing to be seen. As there were a
number of bushes, weeds and stunted trees on the
steep banks, whoever had jumped might be lying
unconscious behind some clump. There was nothing
to do but make a search.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<div class="img" id="p156">
<img src="images/p156.jpg" alt="Searching near the track" width="500" height="250" />
</div>
<p>Jim climbed up and down the sloping sides of the
stream covering the area where anyone might possibly
have fallen. When his efforts turned out to be
fruitless, he decided there could be only one other
solution. If the man had landed in the stream, there
was sufficient water to carry him along to the shallows
on the other side of the bridge. Although the
water was only a few feet deep, an injured or unconscious
man could drown. Working his way downstream
under the bridge, Jim reached the shallows
about a hundred yards on the other side of the tracks
without finding any body. Puzzled, he decided to
give up the search. Perhaps he had just imagined
someone had jumped. As he was slowly making his
way back, he heard the sound of rapid hoofbeats.
Panic-stricken, he rushed as fast as he could along
the slanting banks. He clambered to the top and
looked around for Ticktock. The mustang was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>He looked up the road and there disappearing in
the distance was his beloved horse. Hunched over
the pony&rsquo;s back, urging him to greater speed, was
the figure of a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back, you dirty horse thief!&rdquo; screamed
Jim at the top of his lungs, with rage and panic
in his voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>He continued to shout uselessly as the figure of
the horse and rider grew smaller in the distance.
Finally a curve in the road hid them from view.
Heartbroken, Jim sat down by the side of the road.
He buried his face in his hands and his body shook
with sobs. It was a disaster much worse than any
he could possibly have imagined. His beloved mustang
had been stolen. He sat by the roadside for a
long time before he looked up. The cheery sunshine
of a few minutes earlier had suddenly become hard
and bitter. The bright world had turned ugly, drab
and cruel.</p>
<p>Finally he got to his feet and started plodding dejectedly
down the road. It was a long desolate walk.
Each step seemed to take him farther from Ticktock.
His parents saw him when he finally came forlornly
up the lane. With his slow pace and sorrowful face,
he was a heartbreaking sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Jimmy?&rdquo; asked his mother,
running to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone stole Ticktock,&rdquo; he said with a quavering
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stole Ticktock?&rdquo; asked Mr. Meadows incredulously.
&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a man jump off a freight,&rdquo; said Jim
slowly. &ldquo;I thought maybe he was hurt. While I was
hunting for him, he stole Ticktock. He must have
been hiding behind some bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the dirty rat,&rdquo; said Mr. Meadows, his rage
mounting as he listened to the details. While he had
threatened to get rid of the horse a few months
earlier, now the idea that anyone would steal his
son&rsquo;s mustang made him furious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in to
call the sheriff. That horse is so well known the
thief won&rsquo;t be able to get far. We&rsquo;ll get Ticktock
back, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two days went by, and they didn&rsquo;t get Ticktock
back.</p>
<p>The sheriff passed the alarm to surrounding
towns, while the Springdale <i>Gazette</i> carried big
headlines warning everyone to be on the lookout. It
forgot its usual joking tone about Jim and his horse
and seriously asked everyone to cooperate in the
search. Bill Arnold even had a front-page editorial
on the subject.</p>
<p>Jim sat at the telephone waiting for news, but
there was no joyous message. He was grief-stricken
and refused to be consoled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel so bad,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meadows comfortingly.
&ldquo;You have money enough to buy another
horse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want another horse. I want Ticktock,&rdquo;
said Jim.</p>
<p>While he was deep in misery, Jim did not lose
hope. Somehow he felt that Ticktock would escape
from the thief and return. He was confident that no
matter how far the mustang might be ridden he
would discover the way back home. The third day
following the theft was Saturday. The family tried
to persuade Jim to go to town to take his mind off
his loss, but he was firm in insisting on staying
home. A message was sent to Colonel Flesher that he
would not be in for work for the sale. Ticktock
might possibly return, Jim felt, and he wanted to
be home to greet him.</p>
<p>Jim sat sadly on the front porch after the family
left for town, looking up and down the road hoping
to see the mustang. Three days was a long time. A
man could ride a horse a great distance in that
length of time. Still Jim kept gazing at the road
hopefully. Suddenly he jumped up and rubbed his
eyes. He had been searching so long that he thought
he was now dreaming. He looked again and still saw
the same wonderful sight. Ticktock was jogging
contentedly down the road toward home.</p>
<p>Jim ran to the gate to meet his horse. He threw
his arms around the pony&rsquo;s neck and hugged him
through sheer joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You came back, boy, you came back!&rdquo; he cried
happily.</p>
<p>Ticktock closed one eye and winked. He wasn&rsquo;t a
demonstrative horse.</p>
<p>As Jim started to lead his prodigal pony into the
yard, he noticed for the first time that Ticktock
wore no bridle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you had to slip your bridle to get away,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Well, you did a good job. We&rsquo;ll get another
old bridle. I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;re tired and hungry. You
must have come a long way; so I&rsquo;ll take the saddle
off and let you rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the saddle was removed, there was very
little perspiration beneath the blanket. The hair was
scarcely ruffled. Jim stood back and looked at Ticktock
in puzzlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look as if you had come so far,&rdquo; he
observed. &ldquo;In fact, you look as if you had just been
groomed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened one of the saddlebags. He usually carried
a curry comb and brush with him so that he
could use them in odd moments. The implements
were still there, but it was hard to tell if they had
been used. Whatever the thief had used, Ticktock
had obviously been groomed only a short time before.
The pony didn&rsquo;t look tired either, but acted
quite fresh and frisky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>Noticing that the other saddlebag bulged suspiciously,
Jim opened it. There, folded neatly, was the
missing bridle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now why would anyone fold up a bridle and put
it in the saddlebag?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<p>Ticktock didn&rsquo;t answer but just nuzzled his master
contentedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If someone wasn&rsquo;t going to ride you for a while,&rdquo;
said Jim musingly to his pony, &ldquo;he would take off
your saddle as well as your bridle. If he was going
to ride you in a few minutes, he either wouldn&rsquo;t
take off the bridle at all or at most hang it on a tree
limb or the saddle horn. But that bridle was carefully
put away in the saddlebag. There&rsquo;s something
fishy here. I don&rsquo;t believe that thief is so far from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more Jim thought about the matter, the more
puzzled he became. But no matter what the solution,
he was very angry with whoever had stolen
his horse. According to all the books he had read and
movies he had seen, a horse thief was considered
three degrees lower than a murderer. Jim agreed
with the Western idea. Turning over such thoughts
in his mind, he finally came to a decision. He
saddled Ticktock, put on the bridle and then went
into the house. He opened the closet to his father&rsquo;s
room and carefully got out a twenty-two rifle. He
had been forbidden to touch his father&rsquo;s firearms,
but he felt this case was different. There was a
heavy deer gun in the closet too, but that looked too
forbidding. He found five twenty-two long shells in
his father&rsquo;s bureau, which he carefully stuck in his
pocket. It was a single shot rifle, and he knew how
to load it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Going back downstairs, he found a pencil and
paper and wrote a short note that he left lying on
the kitchen table.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Dear Dad and Mom:</i></p>
<p><i>Ticktock came back and is all right. I have gone
to look for that low-down horse thief. If I catch him
alive, I hope they hang him.</i></p>
<p><span class="jr"><i>Jim</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very grim-faced, Jim mounted and rode off in
the direction from which Ticktock had come. He
had no idea where he was going to hunt for the
thief, but to hunt anywhere was a form of action.
He jogged along, so overjoyed to be back on his horse
once more that he paid little attention to where the
pony was heading. Suddenly he realized that he was
entering Briggs Wood. At the proper point Ticktock
turned off the road toward the hideaway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we might as well go there as anywhere
else,&rdquo; said Jim cheerfully. He really didn&rsquo;t have
much hope of locating the thief anyhow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>At the clearing, Jim dismounted to stretch his
legs. He sat down contentedly on a big rock by his
fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are, back together again at the
old hangout, Ticktock,&rdquo; he observed happily to the
pony.</p>
<p>He tossed a rock into the ashes of the fireplace.
Nothing could keep him and his mustang down.
Then he noticed that the disturbed ashes were smoking
slightly. Alarmed, he poked in the fireplace with
a stick. There was no doubt that a fire had been
built there recently. Clutching his gun, he looked
around at the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has been here in our hide-out,&rdquo; he confided
softly to Ticktock.</p>
<p>The pony was not grazing as usual but looking
around inquiringly. Frowning fiercely, Jim tried to
feel as brave as he looked. Cautiously he peered inside
the brush hut. It was empty; so he began to
make a slow circuit of the clearing, staying well
back in the trees. He was approaching the lower
end near the stream, trying to move silently over
the rocky ground when he stumbled over something
projecting from a low bush. He spun around with
his rifle ready, completely forgetting that he had
never loaded the gun. There was a stir in the bush
and then a man&rsquo;s face peered out. Two sleep-clouded
eyes looked at Jim and his rifle. The eyes opened
wide and lost their sleepiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot! Don&rsquo;t shoot! I give up,&rdquo; said a
frightened voice.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><br />Chapter Eleven
<br />The Conspirators</h2>
<p>It was difficult to say which of the two was the
more frightened, the man in the bushes or Jim.
The only difference was that Jim held a rifle.
He didn&rsquo;t know quite what to do with it as all his
training had been to the effect that he should never
point the muzzle of a gun at anyone. So he waved
the gun around uncertainly, first pointing it at the
man and then away. The erratic maneuvers of the
gun muzzle served to terrify the stranger even more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot!&rdquo; he repeated, his frightened eyes
going back and forth as they followed the end of the
waving gun barrel with a horrified fascination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>The man presented a very odd sight. He was
short, but with abnormally broad shoulders and
powerful arms. His heavily muscled body was
stripped to the waist, and he wore nothing but a
pair of faded khaki trousers. This garment was
crumpled and dirty with several jagged tears in the
legs. He was both barefooted and bareheaded. His
brown weathered face and arms had numerous partially
healed scratches and cuts. At first Jim received
an impression of villainous ferocity caused
by the man&rsquo;s mangled face. Then as he calmed down
he saw the stranger had an ugly but rather pleasant
countenance. Also, that powerful chest looked rather
gaunt, for the ribs were beginning to show. Jim
looked at his captive in uncertainty, unable to decide
whether to feel angry, terrified, or sorry for
the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you steal my horse?&rdquo; he asked finally, when
he found his voice. He tried to sound stern, but his
voice insisted on quavering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; denied the stranger, who was more
frightened because Jim was obviously excited than
he would have been had the boy been calm and
steady. &ldquo;I borrowed a horse a couple of days ago but
I took good care of him and turned him loose so he
could go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim thought this over for a minute. The evidence
of the bridle and Ticktock&rsquo;s recent grooming pointed
to the truth of the statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you borrow him?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I went down
to the railroad tracks to see if you were hurt, and
you ran off with my horse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was scared,&rdquo; said the man frankly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
see you were a boy. A railroad cop had just chased
me off that freight. I thought maybe they had
rangers in this state like they have in Texas
and one was after me for bumming a ride. I just
lost my head and ran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; Jim was very annoyed
at anyone&rsquo;s finding his hideaway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I got on the horse I just rode away as fast
as I could. When I came to this woods I slowed down
and let that little horse walk along. All of a sudden
he turned off the road and came here. It looked as
good a spot as any, so I stayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explanation was very logical. For once Jim
wished that Ticktock would refrain from displaying
his intelligence to others. It was all right to be
smart, but to take a stranger to the secret hideaway
was another matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back to the clearing,&rdquo; he said firmly,
motioning with his gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the captive moved forward promptly.
Jim marched behind the man, his nervousness
gone. His brown hands held the gun steadily, and
there was a serious frown on his normally cheerful
face. He couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out the situation. The
stranger seemed perfectly frank and straightforward
in his manner and didn&rsquo;t look like a horse
thief should. According to Jim&rsquo;s conceptions, a
horse thief should be a sullen, villainous man with
a mustache and a long scar on his cheek. This man
was a good-natured, honest-appearing person.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>When they arrived at the clearing, Ticktock was
standing near the brush hut. The man walked up
to him and began patting him on the neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, old fellow?&rdquo; he asked in a soft
persuasive tone. Ticktock seemed to like the man.
He looked over and winked at Jim as if he were
putting the stamp of approval on the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice horse you got here, son,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure is,&rdquo; agreed Jim. He always warmed
toward anyone who appreciated the mustang. Yes,
this whole thing certainly was a puzzle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you let him loose?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a horse thief, do you?&rdquo; asked
the other indignantly. &ldquo;I could see that someone was
taking awful good care of this pony and must like
him. So I turned him loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figure this out.
Why should you be so scared just because you were
riding on a freight? Lots of people do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some states they put them in a chain gang
or jail too, when they catch them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That would explain your running off with Ticktock,&rdquo;
said Jim, reasoning out loud, &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t
account for your staying here in the woods. You
look peaked and hungry to me. Why don&rsquo;t you go
some place where you can get something to eat?
And where are your clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="p169">
<img src="images/p169.jpg" alt="Where are your clothes?" width="500" height="345" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I washed my clothes,&rdquo; said the other nervously.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re hanging over there in the bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s eyes followed in the direction of the pointed
finger. There was a shirt, undershirt and two socks
hanging on a limb. They had obviously been washed,
although it was rather a poor job, since there had
been no soap and only the cold water of the stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t answer the other questions,&rdquo; said
Jim stubbornly. &ldquo;I think you are hiding for some
other reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked at Jim long and searchingly. Apparently
he was reassured by the appearance of the
boy&rsquo;s frank face and steady brown eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth,&rdquo; he said at last.
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m kind of weak from lack of something
to eat. Why don&rsquo;t we sit down, because this is a long
story? And how about pointing that rifle just a little
bit in the other direction? It makes me nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Jim, sitting down on a log,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m keeping this gun handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jim placed the rifle across his knees, he suddenly
realized that he had forgotten to load it. There
was a hollow feeling in the pit of his stomach and a
big lump suddenly came up in his throat, threatening
to choke him. He couldn&rsquo;t very well reach in his
pocket, extract a shell, open the breech, and load the
gun. Nervous as he was, he knew he would be slow
reloading it. He knew how, but had never had much
practice and it might take a long time. The other
man was too close to permit such a maneuver. There
was nothing to do but try not to change expression
and stick it out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; said the captive, commencing
his story and apparently noticing nothing wrong in
Jim&rsquo;s expression or behavior. &ldquo;The law is after me.
I&rsquo;m wanted for killing a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A murderer,&rdquo; said Jim involuntarily. He gulped.
Matters were getting worse by the minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no murderer,&rdquo; said the man with indignant
sincerity. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure in the worst mess that ever
happened to any man. The police are after me, I&rsquo;m
starving, and I don&rsquo;t have any place to go. All of
it&rsquo;s an accident too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s tone was full of so much woe that Jim
felt a wave of sympathy sweep over him. Somehow
he couldn&rsquo;t help liking the man and believing in him.
He didn&rsquo;t look like a murderer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; Jim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a horse trainer&mdash;one of the best in the country,&rdquo;
said the other proudly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve handled all kinds
of horses, from big work teams to race horses. The
last few years I&rsquo;ve been training race horses. I was
working for Mr. Medway and we had his horses at
Churchill Downs just outside Louisville. Last Monday&mdash;it
seems like a year&mdash;I was walking along outside
the stables when I saw a jockey named Willie
Fry in one of the stalls. I don&rsquo;t suppose you know
much about the things people do to horses now and
then at race tracks, but this jockey was doping a
horse. You can dope a horse several ways&mdash;you can
give him something to make him slow and dopey so
he can&rsquo;t run well or you can give him a shot to make
him all hopped up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Jim, so interested that he
forgot about the unloaded rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like a man taking snow-cocaine, any
kind of dope. It makes him think he can do anything.
Well, the same thing happens to a horse. A horse
that&rsquo;s hopped up can run much better than he would
normally. It&rsquo;s bad on his heart, bad all over for that
matter. He&rsquo;s apt to strain himself and be ruined.
Sometimes a horse can run so hard he may go
blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he giving a horse that kind of dope?&rdquo; asked
Jim, full of indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, this was the night before the race and he
was doping a horse to make him sick and slow.
Judges can usually tell a horse that&rsquo;s hopped up,
but it&rsquo;s hard to tell when a horse has been given
something to make him sick or is just naturally not
up to form. Well, I hate to see a horse doped or mistreated
in any way. What made me even madder
was that Willie was doping <i>my</i> horse. Redwing was
the horse, and she was a sure bet to win the next
day. I had most of the money I&rsquo;d saved all summer
on that race.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he want her to win?&rdquo; asked Jim,
puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there could have been several reasons. One&mdash;he
was riding a horse that was the second favorite,
but he knew as well as I did that he didn&rsquo;t have
a chance against Redwing. Then he could have been
paid by the bookies&mdash;they are the men that take bets
on the race&mdash;to fix it so the favorite couldn&rsquo;t win.
That way they could clean up, not only on not having
to pay off on any money on Redwing, but by
putting money up themselves on Willie&rsquo;s horse. Anyhow,
I was really mad. I jumped on Willie and he
started to fight. He pulled a knife on me and so I
grabbed a bottle that was handy. I hit him over the
head, and he dropped like a sack. Blood started
running down his face. I was really scared. I felt
his pulse and couldn&rsquo;t feel a thing. So I lit out of
there and I&rsquo;ve been hiding ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go to the police and tell them
what happened?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was too scared to think straight and then there
were a couple of things against me. No one saw
Willie doping the horse, or the fight, so it would have
been just my word about what happened. Then the
worst thing was that Willie and I had been in a
fight the day before over a girl. I warned him to
stay away from the girl I was going to marry. The
police would play that up big and I wouldn&rsquo;t have
a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You sure are in a tough spot,&rdquo; sympathized Jim.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s even worse that you ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is,&rdquo; said the man mournfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
why I was so scared when I was on that train and
when you came hunting for me. I figured that everyone
had seen the newspapers and was searching
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you planning on doing, just staying
here?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when I first got here I thought that brush
hut and fireplace had been built by some hunters.
The place didn&rsquo;t seem much used, and it wasn&rsquo;t
hunting season; so I thought I&rsquo;d stay until things
sort of quieted down. That is, if I could figure out
some way to eat. Then about noon today I noticed
those jumping bars for a horse. That and the way
that little horse brought me here made me think
that someone was using the place for something. So
I decided I&rsquo;d better move on. I turned the horse
loose and figured I&rsquo;d leave when it was night. I
didn&rsquo;t think whoever owned the horse would be back
inside of an hour. I was wrong. You showed up and
caught me asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you had anything to eat since I saw you
jump off the train?&rdquo; asked Jim solicitously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had two sandwiches that I had in my pocket,&rdquo;
said the man. &ldquo;I picked them up the night before in
a diner near a freight yard. But that&rsquo;s all. I sure
am hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think maybe I could get you something to eat,&rdquo;
said Jim, considering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would believe the truth when you
heard it,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to
turn me over to the law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you. I don&rsquo;t blame you a bit,&rdquo; said Jim.
&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;m going to trust you, I may as well put
this gun down. I am pretty relieved anyhow, because
I forgot to load it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stared at Jim in amazement. &ldquo;Captured
by a boy with an unloaded rifle! I&rsquo;m certainly a
desperate criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim grinned. &ldquo;I think you better stay right here
for a while,&rdquo; he said, taking charge. &ldquo;I can feed you
here and you are better hidden than at any place I
can think of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found me,&rdquo; pointed out the late captive
dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well naturally,&rdquo; said Jim scornfully. &ldquo;This is
my secret headquarters. No one else knows about it
though. Besides, you haven&rsquo;t seen half of it yet. If
you&rsquo;ll promise never to tell, I&rsquo;ll show you everything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have the sacred word of Timothy Dinwiddie,&rdquo;
said the man solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim led the way to the hidden cave. He paused
just outside the entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let anybody ever see you enter here.&rdquo; He
pushed back the bush covering the cave mouth. &ldquo;I
keep a flash light hanging here just inside the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timothy followed the boy inside. He stood with
mouth open as he followed the flash-light beam
around the walls. There were several rows of cans&mdash;baked
beans, vegetables, shoestring potatoes, chow
mein, corned beef and everything possible to preserve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food! Beautiful, beautiful food!&rdquo; said Timothy
in rapture. &ldquo;This is the most wonderful sight I&rsquo;ve
seen since a horse I picked won the Kentucky Derby
about ten years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick out what you want,&rdquo; said Jim, very proud
of his stock of provisions. He was gratified that they
were proving so handy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>In a few minutes the two had a fire going. Baked
beans were warming in a pot while some weiners
were simmering in a frying pan. The coffee began
to boil while Jim was opening a can of peaches.
Timothy sniffed the appetizing odors hungrily and
put more wood in the fireplace. He finally decided
everything was warm enough and dished out a huge
portion. Jim wasn&rsquo;t hungry, but the enjoyment he
received from watching Timothy devour the food
more than repaid him for all the trouble and expense
he had undergone in collecting his stock. After
finishing the first helping, Timothy filled his plate
again. He ate everything down to the last bean. Then
he and Jim had a cup of coffee together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was certainly the finest banquet I ever ate,&rdquo;
said Timothy leaning back in satisfaction. &ldquo;You
really got a well-stocked kitchen here. And that cave
is about the trickiest hiding place I ever laid eyes
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is pretty good,&rdquo; said Jim glowing with pride.
&ldquo;I just laid in that food in case I might need it
sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certainly glad you did. It saved me from
starvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get to town quite often,&rdquo; observed Jim. &ldquo;You
look the stock over, and anything you need or that
gets low I&rsquo;ll pick up at the grocery store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Jim,&rdquo; said Timothy, reaching in his pocket.
&ldquo;I got about thirty dollars. You better take twenty
to buy groceries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your money,&rdquo; protested Jim. When
he decided to be friends with anyone he made no
reservations. &ldquo;You may need it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are the one that needs it. You can&rsquo;t feed a
hungry man like me for nothing.&rdquo; Timothy shoved
the twenty-dollar bill in Jim&rsquo;s shirt pocket. &ldquo;When
you go to town, would you buy any Louisville paper
you can find for the last week. I&rsquo;d like to know what
they are saying about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I can get the recent ones,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be back tomorrow afternoon. Right now I better get
home before my folks, because I left a note saying I
was hunting for the man that stole Ticktock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim rode home bursting with excitement. He
wished there was someone to whom he could tell his
exciting tale, but such a course was out of the question.
Others might not realize, as he did, that Timothy
was the victim of a bad break. Anyone who
would try to dope a horse deserved to be hit on the
head, he decided. He had to guard the secret of Timothy
very closely, because if the police found him
they might hang him. He guessed that&rsquo;s what they
did with murderers.</p>
<p>The family had not returned when Jim arrived.
He destroyed his note and then began grooming
Ticktock. He was busily at work when the Meadows&rsquo;
car drove in the lane. Feeling full of mystery and
importance, he hailed his parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ticktock came back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Meadows. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d it happen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He just came trotting up the road. Got loose I
guess.&rdquo; The explanation seemed so tame compared
to the story he could have told, but he held himself
sternly in check.</p>
<p>The family gathered around to welcome the mustang
back. Mrs. Meadows was very relieved, as she
had worried over her son&rsquo;s evident grief. Jean was
overjoyed. She was becoming almost as fond of the
pony as was Jim. In the general excitement, everyone
talked at once and neither the father nor mother
noticed anything unusual in Jim&rsquo;s behavior. Jean,
however, wasn&rsquo;t to be deceived. She sensed that her
brother was acting a little too mysterious and self-satisfied
to know as little as he did. She said nothing,
but watched him narrowly.</p>
<p>On Monday Jim made some excuse and went to
town early. At the local store, which sold newspapers,
he was able to get Louisville papers from the preceding
Friday through Monday. He was very conscious
of his exciting new r&ocirc;le of helping a hunted man
and played the part with all his usual intensity.
Afraid that it might look suspicious to hunt through
the papers while in town, he stuffed them in one of
the saddlebags without even a glance. While walking
down the street he met Constable Whittaker, to
whom he gave a very cordial greeting. He grinned
to himself. Constable Whittaker represented the only
forces of law and order Jim had ever known. Being
a conspirator who was outwitting Whittaker was
rare fun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>After buying a few groceries at the store, Jim
completed his errands by purchasing a quart of ice
cream and some cigarettes. They were to be a surprise
for Timothy. He didn&rsquo;t know if the fugitive
smoked, but he suspected that he did. He was rather
nervous while buying the cigarettes, as he knew
they were not supposed to be sold to anyone under
twenty-one. However, he had occasionally purchased
them for his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are for a client of mine,&rdquo; he said casually
to the druggist, who didn&rsquo;t think of doubting Jim&rsquo;s
motives.</p>
<p>The ice cream was carefully packed so that it was
still in good condition when Jim arrived at the
hide-out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly are the answer to a man&rsquo;s prayer,&rdquo;
said Timothy, dividing the ice cream into two equal
portions. &ldquo;Ice cream and cigarettes! I really was
craving a smoke. You put those ravens in the Bible
to shame, Jim. Imagine a bird delivering a quart of
ice cream! I prefer a boy with a horse. It&rsquo;s not so
fancy, but it&rsquo;s a good deal more satisfying to the
stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Jim produced the papers and together they went
over each page of all four editions. They made a
hasty search first and then examined each article
thoroughly. Even the financial pages were searched.
There was not a single mention of Timothy Dinwiddie
or his victim, Willie Fry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; said Timothy, scratching his head.
&ldquo;It happened on Monday. You&rsquo;d think there would
still be some mention of the business on Thursday.
I might not be so important as I thought, but Willie
Fry was a well-known jockey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re keeping quiet on purpose,&rdquo; suggested
Jim, who had read his share of mystery
stories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; inquired Timothy
nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes the police keep very quiet in order
not to let a criminal know they are hot on his trail,&rdquo;
Jim said ominously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happened,&rdquo; Timothy said
fervently. He looked apprehensively around at the
woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go to the newspaper office. The editor
and I are pals. He may have the old papers. I&rsquo;ll think
up some story and get the missing ones from Monday
on,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go tomorrow, as it might
look suspicious to be going to town too often. But
Wednesday I&rsquo;ll get them. I&rsquo;ll bring you some fresh
eggs and milk too. Also, we got a lot of melons if
you want one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, oh boy,&rdquo; said Timothy, shaking his head.
&ldquo;You think of everything. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re not a
cop.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c12"><br />Chapter Twelve
<br />Jean&rsquo;s Ride</h2>
<p>The rest of the week went by without further
news. Jim was unable to get the Tuesday
morning paper, the one most likely to contain
news of the murder. They searched all the
others, but with no success. Timothy and he were
still completely in the dark as to what efforts the
police were making. They could only make guesses.</p>
<p>Jim was enjoying himself however. He was playing
an important part in a serious and exciting
game. He kept Timothy well supplied with food, reveling
in his mysterious errands. While at home, time
hung very heavily on his hands. He felt that he
should be doing something. He was bothered about
Jean. He was not going to underestimate her again,
and he knew she was watching him carefully. Also,
her birthday was approaching. She mentioned the
matter several times; so he knew she had not forgotten
the promise he had made. While he supposed
Timothy could hide elsewhere on that day, it would
be difficult to remove all traces of his recent occupancy.
Also, part of the safety of the hide-out would
be destroyed once Jean knew the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Before it had been merely a matter of personal
pride that kept Jim from telling Jean. Now it was
a serious matter&mdash;a man&rsquo;s life was involved.</p>
<p>To cover up his nervousness and unrest, Jim began
teaching Ticktock a few new tricks. He had long
since taught the mustang to stand quietly in one
spot when his reins were dangling, not to crop grass
while a rider was in the saddle, and various other
accomplishments of a good riding horse. Now he
tried a new idea. He enlisted the aid of his sister
for the instruction.</p>
<p>Jim would go a few feet away from his sister and
the horse, then Jean would say, &ldquo;Ticktock, go to
Jim.&rdquo; When the mustang did as he was told, he
would receive a piece of sugar or apple as a reward.
The process would then be reversed and the pony
told to go to Jean. They gradually lengthened the
distance until finally Jean was some distance down
the road. Ticktock caught on rapidly, trotting back
and forth between the two carrying out his orders.
In a few days he was thoroughly schooled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>Jim then began instructing Jean in riding. Much
of his information had been picked up only recently
from Timothy, who had a vast store of knowledge
about horses and riding in general. The horse trainer
had once worked in a riding academy and had given
riding lessons. Jim was an apt pupil and followed
his new teacher&rsquo;s advice religiously. He seldom had
to be told twice. He learned the proper way to sit in
the saddle, how to hold the reins correctly and various
do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts of riding. For the first time he
heard of the art of posting.</p>
<p>All this information was passed on to Jean. Jim
spoke in such an authoritative manner that Jean
knew he was not inventing his technical terms or
making up his riding lore. There had been a noticeable
improvement in his riding lately which she
hadn&rsquo;t failed to see. As a detective, Jean put her
brother to shame. She missed nothing. Aware that
Jim had not been visiting anyone she knew who was
a riding expert, she said nothing but continued to
observe. She hadn&rsquo;t missed the frequent trips to
town and other rides in the direction of Briggs
Woods. As for the milk and eggs that disappeared,
she had noted that bit of information down too.
When Jim slipped away with a watermelon, she definitely
decided something very mysterious was taking
place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Jean considered the theory that someone was giving
her brother riding instruction and information
for which he was paying in food. But why was he so
mysterious about it all. If he was openly taking lessons
from someone, he would be certain to talk about
it, even boast somewhat. No, there was more to the
matter than was covered by such a simple explanation.
She was just as decisive as her brother and
even though only ten, when she made up her mind,
she acted. So she devised a plan.</p>
<p>Jean had long since gotten over her timidity concerning
Ticktock and had ridden him occasionally
before. Now she applied herself and obediently followed
Jim&rsquo;s instructions. She began riding Ticktock
daily around the farm. Mr. Meadows was somewhat
opposed to the idea, as he thought his daughter was
too young to be riding Ticktock. Although small for
a mustang and called a ranch pony, Ticktock was
far from being any Shetland pony. Any fall from
his back would be a long distance for such a small
girl. Although he no longer had any worries about
Jim and Ticktock, Mr. Meadows still considered the
mustang to be rather high-spirited and apt to be
vicious with anyone who didn&rsquo;t know him too well.
In spite of the parental disapproval, Jean spent
more time each day learning to ride on the little
horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Friday Jim had to help his father all day. At noon
Jean asked to ride Ticktock; so Jim saddled the
horse and then went back to the field with his father.
After several hours of intermittent riding around
the yard, Jean decided that the time had come for
action. Casually she went into the house to find her
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll ride down the road a way,&rdquo; she
announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; warned her mother, who did not
share her husband&rsquo;s fears about Ticktock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. I may be gone a little while so don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she was out of sight of the house, Jean
urged the mustang to a faster pace and headed
toward the woods. She knew the trail to the hide-out
began somewhere near the middle of the forest. It
was very gloomy in the heavy shade, but that just
added to the excitement for her. Resolutely she rode
on.</p>
<p>Had Jean allowed Ticktock to have his head once
they were in the forest, he would have undoubtedly
taken her straight to the hideaway, as he had Timothy.
The way was old and familiar to him now. But
Jean insisted on directing the little horse. While she
had taken quite a few peeks on her blindfolded trip
to the hide-out, she hadn&rsquo;t seen quite enough. Jim
had circled and doubled back, which misled her too.
The woods were confusing, one trail or stream looking
like another. She knew they had roughly followed
a stream for a distance, so she chose one and
boldly plunged into the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>It was difficult riding, trying to duck branches or
push them out of the way. Jean couldn&rsquo;t tell too well
where she was going, and after some distance she
began to be discouraged and tired. She was determined,
however. Any trouble was acceptable if she
could only show up her brother and find the hideaway.
She was certain that if she found the place
she would also solve the mystery of why he was now
taking away perishable food.</p>
<p>Seeing nothing that looked familiar, Jean stopped
for a few minutes to rest and get her bearings. As
she did so, she saw a tree loaded with persimmons
on the opposite bank of the stream. She dismounted
and picked a spot to cross. It was a tiny rivulet, but
it had deep steep banks from the spring floods. She
walked upstream until she found a spot where she
could cross. Returning to the tree, she began climbing.
She was reaching out for a particularly large
persimmon when she lost her balance and fell. She
landed on her back with a breath-taking thump and
then tumbled on down the bank of the stream. Her
right foot hit a rock at the bottom and doubled under
her. There was a wrench and a horribly sharp pain.
Her scream of anguish brought Ticktock to the
bank. He peered down at the huddled heap at the
bottom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<div class="img" id="p188">
<img src="images/p188.jpg" alt="Peering down at the huddled heap" width="500" height="336" />
</div>
<p>Jean lay moaning and crying for some minutes.
The pain subsided a little, so she sat up and dried
her tears. She wanted nothing now but to get back
to Ticktock and go home. Cautiously she tried standing.
The slightest weight on her foot brought a yell
of pain. She got back on her knees and tried crawling
up the bank. It was too steep, the soft ground
caving in and letting her slide back down to the
bottom. If she had had the use of both legs, she might
have managed to scramble up to the top, but it was
impossible in her crippled state. Discouraged and
frightened, she gave up and began to cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>No one could find her, she was certain. Ticktock
couldn&rsquo;t get down to where she was and she couldn&rsquo;t
climb to him. She was tired, dirty, and her ankle
hurt. She looked at the injured member, which was
swelling rapidly. It was nearly twice as large as her
left ankle. The sight frightened her even more. Perhaps
it was broken, and she would just have to stay
there and slowly starve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Ticktock looked down solicitously. He knew something
was wrong but didn&rsquo;t quite know what to do
about it. He stepped closer to the bank to see better,
but it began to crumble. He moved back out of danger
and waited patiently. After Jean had cried herself
out, she began to think calmly once more. At
least it was comforting to have Ticktock standing
by, even though she couldn&rsquo;t use him.</p>
<p>Jean was a resourceful little girl who didn&rsquo;t give
up too easily. She considered all possible ways out
of her predicament and finally had an idea. She
would send Ticktock for help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ticktock, go to Jim!&rdquo; she ordered, sitting up.
&ldquo;Go on home to Jim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ticktock hesitated. He didn&rsquo;t want to leave Jean,
as he knew she was in trouble. Also, he had been
taught to stand still while his reins were dangling.
He stirred indecisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, go home to Jim,&rdquo; repeated Jean commandingly.</p>
<p>It was an order; so the mustang decided to obey.
He started off. He went a few paces and then looked
around mournfully over his shoulder, hoping his instructions
would be changed. Jean simply repeated
her words. Reluctantly he went back through the
woods and headed for home. He began trotting down
the road. Repeatedly he stepped on his reins and
jerked his head down savagely. Finally one sharp
jerk broke them and he went rapidly down the road
with his broken reins trailing behind him on the
ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Mrs. Meadows became alarmed about four-thirty
at her daughter&rsquo;s long absence. Finally she could
stand the worry no longer. She went to the big dinner
bell in the back yard and rang it vigorously. It
was used to summon her husband from the fields,
and she knew he would come running at once on
hearing the bell ring at this unexpected hour of the
day.</p>
<p>Mr. Meadows and Jim left their work and headed
for the house immediately. Jim&rsquo;s mother had just
finished explaining when Ticktock appeared over
the hill, riderless.</p>
<p>The little mustang was covered with sweat and
dust. The farther he went from Jean the more the
pony realized something was decidedly amiss. His
only thought was to hurry home to Jim. Jim was his
god and could solve all things. He dashed into the
yard and obediently slid to a halt in front of the boy.
He had carried out instructions.</p>
<p>Mr. Meadows looked at the lather-covered mustang
with his broken reins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that horse has thrown Jean and hurt her, I&rsquo;ll
kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Worried as he was, Jim did not fail to rise to the
defense of his beloved horse. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t throw
Jean. Maybe she fell off and he came back for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to get the car and go back along
the way he came,&rdquo; announced Carl Meadows decisively.</p>
<p>Jim tied a hasty knot in the reins and climbed up
on Ticktock&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me to Jean,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go to Jean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ticktock was not indecisive this time. He turned
around and started back rapidly down the road.
Mrs. Meadows and her husband got in the car and
started slowly after him, scanning the ditches on
both sides. They passed Jim and went on up the
road. He shouted at them as they went by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better wait at the corner and follow me.
Ticktock will take us to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was soon evident where the pony was heading.
When the woods appeared in view, Jim was certain
of at least part of what had happened. Jean had tried
to find the hide-out. He felt positive about that. A
thousand ideas crowded into his mind. If she let
Ticktock have his head, he would have taken her to
the clearing too. And Timothy was hiding there.
Hearing a horse approaching, he would naturally
assume it to be Jim. And then suddenly, if Jean appeared,
what would have happened? He was positive
that Timothy would not have harmed his sister.
Perhaps he might have detained her though, afraid
that she would spread an alarm. In that case, what
would he do? He would have to lead his parents to
the hide-out and betray Timothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>There were other explanations too. Jean might
have suddenly seen Timothy and become alarmed.
If she rode off rapidly through the trees, it would
have been the easiest thing in the world to have
been knocked off by a low branch. In that case she
might be hurt badly. Everything looked black. Jean
might be hurt; Timothy might be turned over to the
police; he might be taken for aiding a criminal; and
lastly Ticktock was once again in Mr. Meadows&rsquo; bad
graces.</p>
<p>So certain was Jim that Jean had gone to the
hide-out that he tried to pull Ticktock back onto
the road when the little horse started off through the
woods before reaching the usual trail. The mustang,
who knew exactly what he was doing, was stubborn
and insisted in turning off the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., Ticktock,&rdquo; said Jim finally. &ldquo;You usually
know where you&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim waited for his parents to arrive in the car.
They climbed out and rather dubiously followed Jim
into the woods. Every few yards they would shout
Jean&rsquo;s name. When they had penetrated about half
a mile into the forest, they heard a weak answer.
Jean had heard them. Ticktock kept going forward
confidently until he paused on top of the bank above
the injured girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>Jean was a sorry-looking little girl. Her face was
streaked with tears and dirt while her clothes were
torn, wet and muddy. But she was very happy to be
at last out of her predicament. She had been lonely
and frightened, waiting alone in the woods after
Ticktock had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to climb the persimmon tree and fell down
here,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get up; so I sent
Ticktock for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim listened to the vindication of his faith in Ticktock
in silence. He was very relieved to find Jean and
know that she wasn&rsquo;t too badly hurt. They were still
too close to his hide-out to suit him though, and he
wouldn&rsquo;t feel safe until they were clear of the woods.
Also, this was scarcely the time to point out how intelligently
Ticktock had acted. His parents were still
too absorbed in Jean and the extent of her injuries.</p>
<p>Ticktock led the way back to the road while Mr.
Meadows carried Jean in his arms. When the little
party reached the car, the others drove off, leaving
Jim to follow home alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Jim let the little pony take his time on the road
back. He felt much relieved but still uneasy. He
wondered what Jean would say if they asked her
what she was doing in the woods. He felt rather
guilty about her mishap. After all, it was mainly his
fault.</p>
<p>If he had shown her the way that first day, she
would never have gone off on her trip of exploration.
It had been rather mean of him, considering that
she had found the cave, which was the most valuable
feature of the secret rendezvous. So if her leg
were broken, he supposed that he was really responsible.</p>
<p>The doctor was at the house by the time Jim arrived.
He was busy with Jean; so Jim rubbed Ticktock
down and put him in the orchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hero, old boy,&rdquo; he said fondly. &ldquo;You got
me out of a pretty ticklish mess by being so smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just sprained badly,&rdquo; the doctor was saying as
Jim entered the house. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d better stay in bed a
day or two. That&rsquo;s the only way I know of to keep
active children from moving around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean had her dinner in bed, rather enjoying being
in the limelight. After he had eaten, Jim got a
chance to talk to his sister alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you were looking for the hide-out,&rdquo;
he said hesitantly.</p>
<p>Jean nodded her head. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told anybody
though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl,&rdquo; said Jim with a thankful sigh. &ldquo;It
was mean of me not to show you before. As soon as
you can get around I&rsquo;ll take you there, even if it
isn&rsquo;t your birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said anything about the milk and eggs
you took either,&rdquo; said Jean calmly. &ldquo;What are you
feeding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked at his sister with hesitation. She certainly
had shown that she could keep a secret. She
deserved to be in on the excitement, he decided. Perhaps
that would make up in some part for his having
indirectly caused her accident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Jean,&rdquo; he said, lowering his voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
you the whole story....&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c13"><br />Chapter Thirteen
<br />The Mystery Is Solved</h2>
<p>The next morning Jim rode to Springdale
for newspapers and supplies for Timothy.
Purchases were becoming rather difficult of
late. Perhaps it was merely his fancy, but he felt
that the man in the store was beginning to look
at him curiously when he made his daily purchase
of several newspapers. As for cigarettes, Jim had
bought what he felt was his limit without exciting
suspicion. He would have to think of some new solution
for Timothy&rsquo;s tobacco problem. The last quart
of milk purchased had brought forth a comment
from the clerk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got any cows on that farm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; replied Jim, with what he considered
magnificent nonchalance. &ldquo;This is for a customer.
I run errands of all sorts you know. Don&rsquo;t need a
good rural delivery boy, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling that he had allayed suspicion for the moment,
Jim rode off toward the hide-out. While the
intrigue he was carrying on with Timothy was the
most exciting adventure in which he had ever taken
part, he had to face facts. Avoiding questions was
bound to become increasingly more difficult. Also,
the end of summer vacation was not too far distant.
Going to school, doing his chores at home, and continuing
the operation of the Pony Express was
going to make a very stiff schedule without the
added labor of having to administer to the wants
of Timothy. Cold weather would add further complications.
How would Timothy heat the cave? Also,
there was the matter of money. While he was still
operating on the original twenty dollars that Timothy
had given him, sooner or later the money would
be exhausted. Jim didn&rsquo;t begrudge using some of his
own money to provide for his new friend, but if the
proceeds of the Pony Express were all used up for
food, in time it would grow irksome. He could see
long years stretching ahead of him during which
he would have to continue the responsibility which
he had assumed. The law didn&rsquo;t forget quickly; there
was no way of knowing when Timothy would come
out of hiding. Unquestionably what was now a thrilling
escapade would develop into a burdensome chore
as time passed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Occupied with such worrisome thoughts, he arrived
at the hide-out. Timothy met him and was so
cheerful that Jim soon forgot his forebodings. He
told the story of Jean&rsquo;s mishap, and they both agreed
that their secret had come perilously close to being
discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to tell Jean everything,&rdquo; explained Jim.
&ldquo;It was only fair, and she can be trusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep a secret from a woman anyhow,&rdquo;
said Timothy sagely. &ldquo;Once they suspect anything is
being kept from them, you haven&rsquo;t got a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together the two began their usual search through
the papers for news about Willie Fry or his assailant.
There was nothing to be found; so Timothy
turned to the sport section to read the racing news.
Suddenly he let out a startled shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; said Timothy excitedly. &ldquo;Fireball
won the fourth at Havre de Grace and was ridden
by Willie Fry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim examined the paper. Timothy was correct;
Willie Fry had ridden in the fourth race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t two jockeys named Willie Fry are
there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard of any other except the rat I
socked,&rdquo; said Timothy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you didn&rsquo;t kill him after all. Maybe you
just knocked him out. He probably came to and
didn&rsquo;t even notify the police. That&rsquo;s why we haven&rsquo;t
noticed anything in the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t have any pulse when I felt his
wrist,&rdquo; said Timothy wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you need some lessons on how to feel
pulses,&rdquo; suggested Jim dryly. &ldquo;You were probably
so excited that you couldn&rsquo;t find his.&rdquo; He began to
look casually over the remainder of the sporting
news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Here&rsquo;s a little article about Willie Fry,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Listen! &lsquo;Willie Fry, well-known jockey, was
married yesterday to Miss Alvina Morgan, of Baltimore,
Md. Miss Morgan is well known to racing circles,
as she has accompanied the Roudcroft Stables
string as cook to tracks throughout the country. In
addition to serving delicious food to the Roudcroft
personnel, Miss Morgan is famous for always having
a welcome cup of coffee for any jockey, trainer
or trackman. Track people will be happy to hear that
the new Mrs. Fry will continue at her old post in the
trailer which serves as her kitchen. Coffee will still
be on tap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Willie celebrated his wedding day by winning
the fourth race at Havre de Grace, riding Fireball.
This was the first race ridden by Willie since he was
struck down by an unknown assailant at Churchill
Downs several weeks ago.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Jim, as he finished reading. &ldquo;You just
knocked him out. He&rsquo;s probably just as anxious as
you are to forget the whole thing. If he told who
hit him, you&rsquo;d tell about his doping a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timothy wasn&rsquo;t listening, however, but was staring
incredulously at Jim. &ldquo;Let me see the paper,&rdquo;
he said finally in a strained voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alvina married to Willie! I&rsquo;d never have believed
it.&rdquo; Timothy shook his head as if stunned. Slowly
his disbelief turned to indignation. &ldquo;Why two weeks
ago she was engaged to me! I spent a month&rsquo;s
wages on a diamond ring for her. And now she
marries Willie Fry!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m glad Willie Fry is all right,&rdquo; went
on Timothy calming down. &ldquo;Just sort of shakes your
faith in human nature, though, a thing like this
does. Kind of a jolt to be sweet on a gal and have
her turn around two weeks after you&rsquo;re gone and
marry your worst enemy. Well, they can have each
other for my money. I wish them all the unhappiness
in the world. &rsquo;Spose I&rsquo;m lucky to find out about
Alvina in time. Just doesn&rsquo;t seem possible though
that a woman who can bake an apple pie like Alvina
does would turn out to be so fickle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it sure makes things simpler,&rdquo; said Jim
happily. He could not be bothered by such trivial
matters as a broken heart. &ldquo;Now I suppose you&rsquo;ll
go get your old job back as trainer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo; said Timothy with great feeling.
&ldquo;I may not be hunted by the law anymore, but
my career at the tracks is ruined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Jim, completely baffled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I&rsquo;d be the laughingstock of every track in
the country. Willie has probably concocted some story
about how he scared me away and now he&rsquo;s stolen
my girl. Everyone in the racing business knew I was
engaged to Alvina. No siree, I can&rsquo;t go back to the
tracks now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you do then?&rdquo; asked Jim solicitously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe I can get a job taking care of horses
at some riding stable or breeding farm,&rdquo; said Timothy.
&ldquo;Somebody ought to need a good horse handler.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know where I can get you a job right around
here,&rdquo; said Jim, as a sudden thought struck him.
&ldquo;It would be handling big Percherons though. Do
you know anything about them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="p202">
<img src="images/p202.jpg" alt="Percheron draft team" width="500" height="111" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. I once handled a whole stable of them. One
of the big trucking firms in Milwaukee used to have
some beautiful teams. They used them for some of
their deliveries as sort of advertising. You get six
big prancing Percherons pulling a wagon and it&rsquo;s a
beautiful sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hernstadt raises Percherons, and he&rsquo;s looking
for a good man,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;I found one of his
horses that had strayed; so I&rsquo;m in good with him.
We&rsquo;ll go see him and I&rsquo;ll recommend you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like a good idea,&rdquo; said Timothy. &ldquo;I
look pretty ragged, though, to be applying for a
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ride in town and buy you a new shirt and
overalls,&rdquo; volunteered Jim. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go see Mr.
Hernstadt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim was back with the new clothes in slightly over
an hour. After Timothy had changed, they both
mounted Ticktock and rode into town, where Timothy
had his hair cut. After eating lunch they set
out for the Hernstadt farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly owe you a lot,&rdquo; said Timothy as they
approached their destination. &ldquo;Whether I get the job
or not, you certainly have gone to a lot of trouble
for me. A guy that helps you when you&rsquo;re in trouble
is a real friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you weren&rsquo;t a real crook,&rdquo; said Jim, embarrassed
by Timothy&rsquo;s gratitude. &ldquo;The minute
Ticktock liked you, I figured you could be trusted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I owe this little horse plenty too,&rdquo; said Timothy.
&ldquo;After he has carried double for so far, I&rsquo;m not sure
he&rsquo;s going to like me anymore though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Mr. Hernstadt,&rdquo; said Jim when
they arrived. &ldquo;This is Timothy Dinwiddie, a friend
of mine. He&rsquo;s a very good horse trainer. I remembered
that you asked me to find you a good man to
handle horses; so I brought him over to see you. The
Pony Express always gets its man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to meet you,&rdquo; said Mr. Hernstadt, shaking
hands with Timothy. &ldquo;What experience have you
had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes the two men were deep in horse
talk, much of it far too technical for Jim. It was
apparent to the horse breeder, after a short conversation,
that Timothy definitely knew horses. The
three of them made a tour of the stables, Mr. Hernstadt
explaining the various duties of the job. Jim
walked through the immaculate barns with their
modern equipment, his eyes wide with interest.
Every convenience he saw he wanted for Ticktock&rsquo;s
stall. They finally ended their tour at a small shed
that contained a forge, an anvil and complete blacksmithing
equipment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather difficult to find a good blacksmith
these days,&rdquo; explained Mr. Hernstadt. &ldquo;Everyone
uses tractors, and there isn&rsquo;t enough business to
keep a good blacksmith going. I had so much trouble
finding a man who really knew how to shoe a
horse that I bought this equipment to do it myself.
Ever shoe a horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many a time,&rdquo; said Timothy confidently. &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t shown me anything yet, Mr. Hernstadt, that
I can&rsquo;t handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you. If you want to try the job for a
month, I&rsquo;ll be glad to have you. There are nice quarters
over that harness shed where you can live. Come
on and I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The details of salary and duties were settled and
Timothy declared his intention of going to work immediately.
He was very enthusiastic about his new
job, liking his employer, and admiring the horses
and all the modern equipment. Feeling very satisfied
at the way matters had turned out, Jim prepared
to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I owe the Pony Express for finding me
a good man to handle horses?&rdquo; Mr. Hernstadt asked
Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; answered Jim. &ldquo;This comes
under the heading of good will. Employment service
is a little out of our line. I was just doing this
as a favor to a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thank you very much,&rdquo; said the farmer
laughing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to do something for the Pony Express
though,&rdquo; said Timothy. &ldquo;I owe the firm a lot. If it&rsquo;s
all right with you Mr. Hernstadt, when I get the
time I&rsquo;d like to use the blacksmith shop to shoe
Ticktock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, any time you like,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Hernstadt
cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him over in about two weeks,&rdquo; said Timothy.
&ldquo;By then I&rsquo;ll know my way around and be
able to find the time. He needs reshoeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering
where I was going to get him shod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll float his teeth too,&rdquo; said Timothy. &ldquo;I was looking
at them one day and they could stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does &lsquo;floating his teeth&rsquo; mean?&rdquo; Jim inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those back teeth are called grinders,&rdquo; explained
Timothy. &ldquo;They grind up the grain and after a
while they get sharp edges and points. Ticktock&rsquo;s
aren&rsquo;t so bad, as apparently he hasn&rsquo;t had too much
grain. Anyhow, unless you file away those sharp
edges, the horse can&rsquo;t chew the way he should. When
the teeth get really bad a horse gets out of condition
and sometimes has colic. Filing down the teeth is
called floating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t wrong when you said he knew
horses,&rdquo; said Mr. Hernstadt to Jim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>As soon as Jim reached home, he told his sister
about the happy ending to Timothy&rsquo;s story. She was
very pleased that the trainer was no longer a fugitive
from justice, but her pleasure seemed overshadowed
by her worry about Timothy&rsquo;s broken heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; said Jim, who couldn&rsquo;t understand
her concern. &ldquo;Why should he worry about a
woman when he&rsquo;s got twenty-three horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later that evening Jim sat contentedly in the living
room reading a book about the West in the days
of the pioneers. He was deeply engrossed in a running
battle between a wagon train and the Indians
when the clock struck nine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bedtime, Jim,&rdquo; said Mr. Meadows.</p>
<p>Jim was feeling too happy and satisfied with the
world in general to put up his usual fight against
bed. He stood up obediently, and with his nose still
buried in the book, started to walk toward the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said Mr. Meadows, embarrassedly clearing
his throat, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something I wanted to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad,&rdquo; said Jim looking up in surprise at his
father&rsquo;s rather red face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about that horse of yours,&rdquo; said Mr. Meadows
lamely. &ldquo;I guess I was wrong about Ticktock. He&rsquo;s
a pretty smart horse, the way he led us to where
your sister was. I think we can find room and feed
enough to keep him permanently.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Dad,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His world was very full of happiness. Knowing
how difficult it was for his father to make such a
speech as he had just heard, he was deeply appreciative.
Jim, like his father, was unable to act very
demonstrative, so having expressed his thanks, he
hurried upstairs to bed. They understood each other,
he and his father. Although they didn&rsquo;t say much,
each knew how the other felt.</p>
<p>Jim dropped off to sleep with a contented smile
on his face. Ticktock was his forever, Timothy was
safe now, and the hide-out was still undiscovered.
It was a very satisfactory world.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><br />Chapter Fourteen
<br />The Fire</h2>
<p>Ticktock also went to sleep that night with
a contented grin on his face. As a reward
for having carried double for so many miles,
and in general celebration of the happy state of affairs,
Jim had given him two apples and an extra
large portion of oats. It was a moderately cool night
with few flies to bother him; so the mustang dozed
off while still munching on his last mouthful of oats.
He stood swaying dreamily on his feet, while visions
of sugar cubes, dew-drenched clover, and whole bins
full of oats floated through his brain. In the midst of
his dream, the sweet odor of clover slowly changed
to a smell that was foreign and unpleasant. The
mustang stirred uneasily and shook his head in
annoyance but the disturbing odor persisted. Sleepily
he opened his eyes and then snorted in sudden
alarm. The foreign smell was unmistakably smoke!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Mr. Meadows had completed the building of a new
brooder house during the day. The scraps of lumber,
together with other refuse, had been dumped in the
incinerator and burned. The fire had been inspected
just before dark when everything had appeared to
be burned with the exception of a few small smoking
embers. Unfortunately, the inspection had not
been thorough enough for there were a number of
pieces of tar paper roofing in the back of the incinerator.
They smoldered harmlessly for several
hours until the night breeze shifted. Suddenly they
burst into flame and burned as only tar paper can
burn. A shower of sparks went up into the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Straw collects in every barnyard and the Meadows&rsquo;
yard was no exception. There had been no rain
for over a week; so the wisps of straw lying around
were ripe for burning. The wind had deposited a
small pile of loose straw against a lean-to which was
built onto one end of the barn. A spark landed in this
pile and in a few minutes the straw was burning
merrily while the wind whipped the flames against
the dry boards of the lean-to, filling the interior with
smoke. Since this shed joined one end of the barn,
smoke began to filter through the cracks into Ticktock&rsquo;s
stall. The fire was just catching the shed
when the horse had awakened with his start of
alarm.</p>
<p>Ticktock had been around many campfires with
Jim, but he had always been free to move a respectful
distance away and to stand clear of the smoke.
This was a different situation, which was not at all
to his liking. As the smoke grew thicker he decided
something was amiss. He snorted and jerked his
head as the acrid fumes began to tickle his nostrils
and smart his eyes. By twisting his neck he could
see bright tongues of flame through the cracks in the
wall and he was inspired with fresh terror. The
smoke grew thicker until it interfered with his
breathing. He moved around as much as he was able
in his confined stall, growing more frightened each
minute. He decided it was time to leave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>The pony tried backing out of his stall, but he
came to the end of his halter rope in a few feet. He
pulled until his neck ached but still the rope held.
Then he moved forward until there was a small
amount of slack in the tether. He gave a violent toss
of his head. There was a painful wrench as the rope
snapped taut. This method was no more successful
than the first, but there seemed no other course but
to try again. The smoke was growing thicker and
there was no time to lose. The frightened pony gave
several more violent tugs until finally, after one
particularly desperate yank, the rope snapped. As
he backed from the stall, Ticktock could hear the
uneasy stirrings of the other horses and cattle, who
although farther from the fire than he, were now
awake and becoming frightened too.</p>
<p>Freeing himself from the halter rope was only
half the battle, for he still had to get out of the barn.
The door which was almost directly back of his stall
was the usual double barn door. The stock had been
put in the barn because it had looked very much
like rain. However, the upper halves of the doors
had been left open, so that it wouldn&rsquo;t become too
hot inside. Ticktock stuck his muzzle over the lower
half to breathe gratefully the fresh night air. A few
deep breaths restored his energy enough and calmed
him sufficiently for him to consider the remainder of
his problem. There was not room enough to try to
jump over the closed part of the door. After surveying
the situation appraisingly, the little mustang
turned around until his back feet were pointing
toward the opening. His motto had always been,
&ldquo;When in doubt&mdash;kick.&rdquo; With no hesitation he went
into action. Kicking was one of his major accomplishments;
so three hefty blows were enough to
break the door open. If a horse can give a sigh of
relief, he gave one when he bolted into the open
barnyard. Perhaps it was just a huge gulp of fresh
air but it sounded like a sigh of relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Once outside, Ticktock could see the burning shed
clearly. He trotted to the other side of the yard
where he was in safety and then turned to look over
the situation again. It was only a matter of time
until the barn proper was on fire, trapping all the
animals in it. He could hear the movements of these
animals who were rapidly growing frantic. Although
he personally was out of danger, Ticktock knew that
something terrible was happening. His own feelings
when he had been in the barn were still fresh enough
in his mind to make him nervous. He thought the
matter over. That blazing shed was wrong. It didn&rsquo;t
fit into the proper scheme of things around the farm.
When anything was wrong, Ticktock had only one
thought&mdash;to go to Jim. Jim could solve everything.
The mustang trotted toward the fence separating
the barnyard from the grounds around the house.
It was a formidably high board fence, higher than
any he had ever tried. Doubtfully he trotted back
across the yard, knowing the sensible thing to do
was to keep away from the fire and forget that high
fence. The noise made by the trapped animals grew
louder and more panicky. There was a feeling of
terrible urgency that told him he should go to Jim.
Dismissing his doubts, he started running toward
the fence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<div class="img" id="p213">
<img src="images/p213.jpg" alt="Jumping a fence" width="500" height="408" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>The little horse made a magnificent leap, but the
fence was too high for him. His front legs cleared
but his hind legs were a few sickening inches short.
His hooves hit the top of the boards with a resounding
thud that threw him off balance. He got over
the fence but landed wrong. He felt a terrible pain
in his right foreleg as it crumpled beneath him. The
night was split with the heartbreaking scream of a
horse in agony.</p>
<p>Jim sat bolt upright in bed at Ticktock&rsquo;s first
scream, alarmed and confused. When the terrible
piercing sound was repeated, he leaped out of bed
and tore down the hall, shouting as he went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad! Mom! The horses! Something&rsquo;s happened
to one of them!&rdquo; He did not say &ldquo;Ticktock,&rdquo; as the
idea that the shrieking horse could be his beloved
pony was too terrible to admit, even to himself. He
was filled with hideous misgivings, though, as he
raced down the stairs. When he opened the front
door he saw the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! Fire!&rdquo; he shouted at the top of his lungs.
Mr. Meadows did not need the second alarm, as Jim&rsquo;s
first shout had been enough to jerk him out of bed.
He had pulled on his trousers and shoes and was
starting down the stairs when he heard the word
&ldquo;fire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Barefooted and in his pajamas, Jim raced toward
the barn. Halfway there he saw Ticktock. The little
mustang was lying helplessly on his side, screaming
and kicking in terror and pain. Forgetting the fire,
Jim raced toward the stricken horse. He felt a sickening
sense of calamity as he approached Ticktock.
He dreaded going nearer, yet he had to know what
was wrong. Then in the wavering light from the
fire, he saw his worst fears realized; Ticktock&rsquo;s leg
was hanging limp and useless, broken between the
fetlock and the knee.</p>
<p>Few people ever have to face sudden stark tragedy.
There is usually some warning or preparation
that makes the shock more bearable. Jim was not
so fortunate. Out of a happy sleep he had awakened
to this. There was no bottom to the depths of his despair.
This was a tragedy beyond his most horrible
dreams. A terrible numbing agony swept over him,
leaving him nauseated, blinded and stricken. There
was a huge leaden mass where his heart and stomach
had been. He shed no tears but threw himself
in a hopeless heap on the ground beside the horse.
Not knowing what he was doing, he took Ticktock&rsquo;s
head in his lap and began to stroke the mustang&rsquo;s
forehead. He mumbled softly and unintelligibly to
the trembling, terror-stricken horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>Mrs. Meadows, who had dressed by this time, came
out into the yard carrying Jim&rsquo;s shoes, shirt and
trousers. She had turned on the yard light; so she
saw the horse and boy immediately. There was no
need to ask what was wrong. The crumpled leg was
only too evident. Tears of sympathy and grief started
to her eyes, both for the little horse and for her son.
She glanced hesitantly toward the fire, feeling she
should rush to her husband&rsquo;s aid, but she knew what
sickening grief was shaking her son. She had to comfort
him, if only for a moment. Saying nothing, she
walked over to put her hand on his shoulder. Jim
looked up at her dumbly as if struggling for recognition.
Slowly he brought his mind out of its numbness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broken,&rdquo; he said in a hopeless, tired voice.
&ldquo;Broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I ought to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you stay&mdash;&rdquo; she started to say and then
thought better. His help was needed and anything
that would take his mind off Ticktock would help.
&ldquo;Yes, Jim, there are other horses that are trapped
in the barn. You&rsquo;d better help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You help carry water,&rdquo; she warned him as he
pulled on his clothes over his pajamas. &ldquo;Stay out of
the barn unless your father tells you that you can
go in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>Jean came out to drop beside Ticktock in sorrow
almost as great as Jim&rsquo;s. While the girl comforted
the pony, Jim and his mother rushed off to help Mr.
Meadows. With misgivings, Jim&rsquo;s father permitted
him to go into the smoke-filled barn, for help was
needed desperately. The terrorized animals were
threshing about in their stalls so violently that it
was dangerous work to get near them in the smoky
interior to untie them. Choking and blinded, Jim
led out one cow, only to plunge back in again after
another. Mr. Meadows was racing in and out of the
barn like a madman, leading out the huge work
horses. Mrs. Meadows ran back and forth from the
watering tank to the fire carrying water while
anxiously trying to keep tabs on both her husband
and son to see that neither was gone too long, perhaps
lost and overcome by the smoke. Finally all the
stock was safely out in the yard and the two, coughing
and sputtering, turned to help Mrs. Meadows
fight the still growing fire.</p>
<p>They carried water until they were at the point
of exhaustion and the big water tank was almost
empty. Mr. Meadows was the only one strong enough
to throw water onto the roof of the lean-to, which
by this time was burning fiercely. He scorched his
face and arms while his hair and eyebrows became
singed and frizzled. With his face blackened with
soot, he continued to fight the fire with the water
that Jim and his mother pantingly lugged to the
scene. At last they began to make headway and
the boards no longer blazed but smoldered. The
lean-to was almost destroyed, while one end of the
barn was badly scorched and charred. When finally
there were no more bright blazes but only embers,
Mrs. Meadows turned to her son.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go on back to your horse. We&rsquo;ll finish here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim returned to his stricken mustang. During the
fire, excitement had replaced much of his grief, but
now it returned with all its former force. Dejectedly
he sat down beside Jean to stroke the horse&rsquo;s quivering
head. He was still dumbly patting Ticktock&rsquo;s
neck when Mr. Meadows came to stand beside him
some minutes later. Jim looked up at his blackened,
begrimed father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He broke his halter rope and kicked down the
door,&rdquo; said the older man. &ldquo;Why he jumped the fence
into the yard we&rsquo;ll never know. I guess horses can
do a lot more thinking than we realize. He may have
wanted to warn us. If that was his idea, he succeeded,
although he had to break his leg to do it. I
suppose it&rsquo;s small consolation, son, but your pony
saved the barn and all the other stock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>Ticktock had calmed down somewhat now that
Jim was stroking his head again. He was still trembling,
but he no longer tried to struggle futilely to
his feet. The pain, while not the first horrible jabbing
agony, was still present. He rolled his eyes in
fright and only Jim&rsquo;s comforting hand kept him
from writhing about on the ground. Mr. Meadows
knelt down, examining the leg carefully. He straightened
up with a grim expression on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s broken, son,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose you know
that. It&rsquo;s pretty high; so there isn&rsquo;t a chance. You
better go in the house and let me put him out of his
pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Jim, coming suddenly out of his stupor.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t shoot him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; said his father gently. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
the only thing we can do. The only thing that&rsquo;s fair
to Ticktock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call Dr. Cornby,&rdquo; said Jim with a faint glimmer
of hope in his voice. &ldquo;Maybe he can fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the break were lower, there might be some
possibility of saving him,&rdquo; said Mr. Meadows. &ldquo;I
hate to disappoint you Jim, but Dr. Cornby won&rsquo;t
be able to do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can see,&rdquo; said Jim with pleading insistence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go call the veterinarian,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meadows.
She went inside to the telephone.</p>
<p>In a few minutes Jim&rsquo;s mother was back. &ldquo;There
was no answer at Dr. Cornby&rsquo;s home, Jim. It&rsquo;s
eleven-thirty; so I suppose he will be home before
too long. In the meantime I have no idea where to
reach him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What day is it?&rdquo; asked Jim with apparent irrelevance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thursday, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s at the Springdale <i>Gazette</i> office as usual,&rdquo;
said Jim whose mind was functioning again with
its old sharpness. &ldquo;Call him there and tell him how
important it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Cornby was very surprised when he was called
to the telephone. He listened carefully for a few
minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the leg broken?&rdquo; he asked after Mrs.
Meadows had explained what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About four inches below the knee,&rdquo; replied Jim&rsquo;s
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes it tough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not much chance
with the break there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Carl said, but Dr. Cornby, you have
to come out to see the horse,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meadows
desperately. &ldquo;Jim is absolutely heartbroken. Even
if you can&rsquo;t do a thing, it will make him feel better.
That&rsquo;s really why I want you to come, for Jim as
much as the horse. I want him to know that everything
possible is being done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Mrs. Meadows,&rdquo; said Cornby. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
right out. I owe that boy of yours a good turn anyhow.
Keep the horse as quiet as possible in the
meantime.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; asked the editor when Cornby
hung up the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a fire out at the Meadows&rsquo; place. That
mustang kicked his way out of the barn, jumped a
fence, and woke up the family. The trouble is he
broke his leg in the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That kid&rsquo;ll never get over this,&rdquo; said Arnold
sympathetically. &ldquo;Any chance of setting the horse&rsquo;s
leg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Cornby, shaking his gray
head slowly. &ldquo;Depends on what the break is like. It&rsquo;s
pretty high, which is bad. However, I&rsquo;ve got to see
what I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men went to the veterinarian&rsquo;s office,
where the doctor got his bag. After he had all his
instruments carefully stowed, he pulled out a heavy
sack from the closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in that?&rdquo; asked Arnold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick-setting plaster,&rdquo; replied Cornby. &ldquo;I hope
we can use it. Otherwise it&rsquo;s this.&rdquo; He pulled a forty-five
from his desk drawer, examined it, inserted a
clip and stuck it in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Arnold, &ldquo;how about that new-fangled
splint you used on your dog? Wouldn&rsquo;t something
like that work?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, maybe not. That was a Stader splint,
and it has been a godsend for small animals and for
men, too, for that matter. On horses, as yet, it&rsquo;s use
is no more certain to effect a cure than a plaster
cast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the editor as they got in the
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the same difficulty as with all methods
of setting a horse&rsquo;s leg. There&rsquo;s simply too much
weight for such small legs. There&rsquo;s experimentation
going on all the time at colleges and veterinarian
schools. Every now and then you read an article that
someone has discovered a new method of repairing
broken bones in horses, but the fact remains that in
most cases the horse is through. A plaster cast is still
the most widely used, and only in isolated cases is
it successful. I hope this is one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c15"><br />Chapter Fifteen
<br />A Long Night</h2>
<p>Jim was still sitting on the ground beside Ticktock
when Dr. Cornby and the editor arrived.
The veterinarian wasted no time, but after a
short greeting to the family, immediately went
to work. Using a flash light, he made a careful examination
of the broken leg. Jim watched every
move with painful anxiety. Hopefully he looked at
Dr. Cornby&rsquo;s face as the latter stood up from his
inspection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you fix it?&rdquo; he asked. There was desperate
pleading in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Jim. It&rsquo;s a clean break, no jagged
edges, so we can try. You can usually set a leg, but
whether it will be successful is always a gamble.
Ticktock and you will play a much more important
part in this than I will. You have a much tougher
job ahead of you than I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to do anything,&rdquo; answered Jim
promptly.</p>
<p>The veterinarian looked around appraisingly and
then issued instructions. A long lighting cord was
found and stretched from the nearest socket to furnish
illumination at the pony&rsquo;s side. The accident
had occurred beneath one of the large trees in the
yard. Thoughtfully Dr. Cornby looked up at a big
limb almost directly overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had equipment, the best thing would be to
move him out to his stall in the barn, but we&rsquo;d need
a tow truck or a derrick to do it. However, there is
always the possibility of doing still more damage by
moving him and, also, the sooner we set the leg the
better. We are lucky in that we can raise him right
here, but if we do, he&rsquo;s going to be here a long time.
Now can you rig up some sort of padded frame like
the side of a stall so Ticktock can lean against it
and rest?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Meadows. &ldquo;We can do
anything that&rsquo;s necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; said the veterinarian. &ldquo;Mrs. Meadows,
you are going to have a horse cluttering up your
back yard for some time.&rdquo; She only smiled to show
her lack of concern, so he continued. &ldquo;First, I need
a good strong block and tackle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The block and tackle was securely fastened to the
limb overhead and then Dr. Cornby produced a wide
canvas bellyband to go under Ticktock&rsquo;s body, a
breeching and a breast strap. He worked rapidly
with only an occasional comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to put him out to keep him quiet,&rdquo; he said,
producing a jug of liquid and a complicated appearing
apparatus with a long tube. &ldquo;This is chloral
hydrate which I am going to administer intravenously
in the jugular vein. Just as simple as giving
plasma to a person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ticktock gave a start of pain and terror as the
vein was pierced but in a few minutes his nervous
trembling had ceased, his legs relaxed, and his head
drooped heavily in Jim&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to raise him to get at that leg,&rdquo; said the
doctor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>By dint of much pulling, pushing and lifting, the
wide bellyband was shoved beneath the mustang&rsquo;s
body and the ends hooked to the block and tackle.
Slowly and carefully the limp horse was raised.
When the inert body was clear of the ground, they
readjusted its position and then secured the breast
strap and breech band in place to keep Ticktock from
sliding out of the sling. The injured animal was then
raised until his feet dangled clear of the ground
by a few inches. A final adjustment was made so
that his hind feet were slightly lower than his fore feet.
With his head hanging limply downward, poor
Ticktock certainly presented a forlorn and pitiful
sight.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Bill Arnold had been preparing
the material for a plaster cast. Dr. Cornby worked
rapidly and soon had the leg set and padded ready
for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a fluoroscope or some means of taking
an X ray to see if I have that bone in exact
apposition,&rdquo; he said as he worked. &ldquo;I have to go by
touch entirely, but I think I&rsquo;ve got it right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the plaster cast had been applied and was
hardening, the veterinarian sat down to relax for a
few minutes. He lighted his pipe and drew in the
smoke gratefully. Jim gave a big sigh of relief and
looked hopefully at Dr. Cornby. He had been afraid
to utter a sound while the doctor had been working,
but now he felt he could talk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be all right now, isn&rsquo;t he, Doctor?&rdquo;
he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could say yes definitely, but I can&rsquo;t, Jim.
The battle has only begun. Only the simple part is
over. I&rsquo;m not going to kid you but tell you just what
can and does happen in most cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; said Jim grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A horse has one of the most sensitive nervous systems
of all animals, which is the one thing that makes
matters so difficult when they have an accident. They
are particularly susceptible to any pain, which makes
them writhe around, kick and do everything they
shouldn&rsquo;t when they have a broken bone. On the
other hand, you can&rsquo;t keep them quiet by keeping
them under dope because their nervous system just
won&rsquo;t stand it for any length of time. That&rsquo;s why a
race horse seldom recovers from a broken leg&mdash;he&rsquo;s
such a nervous animal he won&rsquo;t keep still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ticktock&rsquo;s not nervous,&rdquo; said Jim promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s a rather calm little pony, but on the
other hand, he&rsquo;s no placid cow. I&rsquo;ve seen times when
he acted pretty spirited; so it won&rsquo;t be beer and
skittles keeping him quiet. And you&rsquo;ve got to do it.
Now you notice how sloping a horse&rsquo;s leg is. It&rsquo;s difficult
to keep a plaster cast in place&mdash;if the break
were above the knee it would be next to impossible.
The muscles in the leg are very powerful and if the
horse starts moving, the contraction of those muscles
is enough to pull the bones out of apposition, by
that I mean out of line, and then he&rsquo;s done for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep him quiet,&rdquo; said Jim with determination.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay right here beside Ticktock all the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a long vigil,&rdquo; said Dr. Cornby smiling
sympathetically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be in that sling at
least six weeks. Of course, the first two weeks are
the most important. After that the bone has begun
to knit and won&rsquo;t pull apart so easily. Now the next
thing is to keep him happy and eating. I don&rsquo;t know
how to tell you to do this. You know the horse and
will have to figure it out for yourself. I&rsquo;ve known
some horses that would absolutely refuse to eat anything
when they were in pain. In one case I tried
feeding a horse through a tube to keep him alive.
Now Ticktock shouldn&rsquo;t be in pain after this, but
he&rsquo;ll be nervous being in that sling. You&rsquo;ve got to
keep him calm and happy enough to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim was not discouraged by this ominous warning.
He felt confident that he could keep the mustang
quiet and contented. Ticktock would eat for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s one more problem,&rdquo; said Dr. Cornby.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lower him in a few minutes so that some of
his weight is resting on his feet. I think the way we
have him set most of it will be on his hind feet.
Each day we&rsquo;ll put more weight on his feet until
finally the sling will just be there to keep him from
lying down and for him to use when he wants to
rest. Now some horses never lie down to sleep. I&rsquo;ve
had farmers tell me that some of their horses have
stood as long as a couple of years without lying down
other than to roll when they were in the pasture.
Still there&rsquo;s danger when you force a horse to stand
for six weeks in a sling that he might get laminitis,
or founder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Arnold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same thing that happens when a horse
is overworked, allowed to drink all the water he
wants and then stand. The blood vessels in the feet
are injured. The blood from the arteries passes
through tiny blood vessels, called capillaries, into
the veins and back to the heart. These little blood
vessels are permanently damaged and the coffin joint,
inside the hoof, suffers and drops out of position.
The sole of the foot also drops. You can help mild
cases of founder, but the horse is never up to much
except very light work. Even if he recovers he is usually
lame until his blood warms up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do to prevent it?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Meadows while Jim listened anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, building that padded barricade will give
him a chance to lean against it and rest. Also, it
helps to groom the horse and massage his legs. Don&rsquo;t
touch the broken leg at all for a few days though.
Beyond that there isn&rsquo;t much that can be done but
hope for the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The veterinarian waited until Ticktock awoke,
and then lowered him until his feet touched the
ground lightly. At first the pony was very groggy
and dopey, but as his head cleared he started to
struggle. He could not understand why he was hanging
in the air and was unable to walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, old boy. You&rsquo;re all right now,&rdquo; said
Jim consolingly, patting the mustang on the head.</p>
<p>There was nothing further that Dr. Cornby could
do. As it was after three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he
and the editor prepared to leave. As Dr. Cornby
wearily packed his bag, Jim awkwardly tried to express
his thanks. He was so grateful that he could
find no words adequate to convey the depth of his
feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how you feel, Jim,&rdquo; said Dr. Cornby.
&ldquo;Just forget about it and save all your energies for
the days ahead. You&rsquo;re going to need all you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Jim firmly refused to leave his pony&rsquo;s side, insisting
that he was going to sit up the remainder of the
night beside the injured animal. &ldquo;He might want
some water,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or he might get scared and
start kicking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="p230">
<img src="images/p230.jpg" alt="Horse in a sling" width="500" height="395" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mr. Meadows who had volunteered
to spend the night on watch beside Ticktock.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring out some blankets and fix up a place
where you can lie down if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>Dawn found Jim leaning back against the tree
asleep with a blanket around his shoulders. Ticktock
dozed quietly in his sling, apparently comfortable
and contented. Mrs. Meadows discovered them
still in deep slumber when she came out to call Jim
for breakfast. She looked down fondly at her son&rsquo;s
drawn, tired face, hating to awaken him. Reaching
down, she shook his shoulder gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, Jim,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Come in and have
some breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim was ravenous. He looked at Ticktock, who
still slept peacefully; so he decided to go in to breakfast.
However, as he started toward the house the
mustang awoke and stirred restively. No amount of
persuasion could have made Jim leave then, so his
breakfast was served in the yard. He sat under the
big tree hungrily devouring bacon and eggs, sleepy
and tired, but happy. He then fed Ticktock, lovingly
holding a bucket for the horse to eat and drink. He
refused to go more than a few feet from the mustang,
chasing away every fly and fussing over Ticktock
as if he were a tiny baby. Jean brought apples
and choice bits of clover to offer. The pony, instead
of refusing to eat, accepted everything until Mr.
Meadows became alarmed over Ticktock&rsquo;s large
appetite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, he&rsquo;s not going to get any exercise for
a long time,&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll overfeed him if you
don&rsquo;t watch out.&rdquo; Mr. Meadows sunk two posts near
Ticktock and between them nailed boards which
were padded to allow the mustang to rest against
the structure comfortably.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>The news traveled fast through the countryside
and all morning there was a string of visitors. Some
came out of sympathy for Jim and others out of pure
curiosity. A horse with his leg in a plaster cast was
quite an attraction, particularly a famous horse like
Ticktock. Jean sternly kept all visitors at a respectful
distance, afraid they would alarm the pony.
Shortly after noon Timothy came riding down the
lane astride a huge Percheron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just heard about the accident,&rdquo; he said to Jim.
&ldquo;It was certainly tough luck. I thought I&rsquo;d come
see if there was anything I could do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He examined the injured leg with great interest.
&ldquo;Nice job&mdash;sure hope it works.&rdquo; He wasted no further
words on condolence but promptly took charge
of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While it&rsquo;s good weather we better get things
rigged up for rain,&rdquo; he said with authority. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
fix him a regular stall right here. Roof to shade him
and a manger. It would be just as well not to have
too much of the yard in plain view&mdash;something might
scare him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>Together Timothy and Jim stretched a big canvas
tarpaulin over Ticktock and pegged the sides securely
to the ground. They made a small manger out
of boxes and placed it where it was convenient for
the mustang. Then they spread straw on the ground
around his feet and in a short time had him appearing
very comfortable in a tentlike stall. Timothy finished
matters by giving the little horse a thorough
grooming. The trainer&rsquo;s expert touch and soothing
voice kept the pony quiet and contented and for the
first time since the accident Jim was able to leave
his side without a feeling of alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come over about eight and spend the night
with him,&rdquo; said Timothy firmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already
had one tough night and need some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Timothy stayed beside the injured horse the
second night while Jim slept in his own bed with
the soundness that comes of exhaustion.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><br />Chapter Sixteen
<br />The Convalescence</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>For two weeks Jim and Timothy alternated
nights beside Ticktock. After several days
the mustang seemed resigned to remaining
in one spot but grew very spoiled. Unless someone
were beside him, he wanted to move about. Dr.
Cornby came out daily to inspect Ticktock and check
on progress. Timothy proved invaluable, for each
day he gave the horse a thorough massage and
grooming. His long experience with race horses enabled
him to keep the mustang&rsquo;s muscles in trim in
spite of his lack of exercise. Each time Timothy finished
his daily stint of several hours rubbing and
massaging, Jim gave mental thanks that he had
made the right decision that first day when he had
met Timothy at the hideaway.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>During the day, Jean often spelled Jim in his
vigil beside the pony. School started during Ticktock&rsquo;s
last week in the sling, but the question of
whether Jim should go to school was not even raised&mdash;he
stayed beside his horse. When the day finally
arrived to take Ticktock from the sling, there was a
large audience. Timothy, of course, was present,
having brought Mr. Hernstadt with him. Bill Arnold,
the editor, was there to report the big event
for the Springdale <i>Gazette</i>. Dr. Cornby brought two
colleagues from neighboring towns who watched
with professional interest. Altogether there was a
very attentive gallery as the veterinarian removed
the cast and gave the signal for Mr. Meadows to
lower away slowly.</p>
<p>Ticktock gradually had been allowed to put more
weight on his feet for several weeks so at first when
the sling was removed he noticed no difference. Jim
stood at his head, talking soothingly but watching
anxiously. Then he led Ticktock forward for a few
tentative steps. The mustang walked somewhat uncertainly,
due to his long period of inaction, but he
did not seem to be limping or favoring his injured leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we&rsquo;ve done it,&rdquo; said Dr. Cornby jubilantly.
&ldquo;He seems to be good as new, Jim!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>Jim threw his arms around his horse&rsquo;s neck and
hugged him in ecstasy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right now, Ticktock.
You&rsquo;re all well again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just lead him around for a few minutes a
day at first, Jim. Don&rsquo;t let him run at all for six
weeks and aside from when you&rsquo;re exercising him,
keep him in the stall. You should wait at least three
months before you ride him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim led his horse out to the barn where he had
his stall prepared. He wanted to be alone with the
pony for a few minutes. Tears of happiness were
welling up in his eyes&mdash;tears that he preferred no
one see.</p>
<p>The following week Jim started to school. Ticktock
progressed rapidly and six weeks later was grazing
contentedly in the orchard. He wondered impatiently
why Jim had not ridden him for so long, but
otherwise he was content. One day Mr. Meadows had
just taken a reassuring look at the mustang and was
crossing the yard toward the house when Ticktock
raised his head and, looking down the road, whinnied.
Mr. Meadows followed the horse&rsquo;s gaze with
idle curiosity at first, and then stared in frank puzzlement.
Coming up the road was an odd-looking
wagon followed by a long string of horses. Had Jim
been home, or Ticktock able to talk they could have
told Mr. Meadows that the old man on the driver&rsquo;s
seat was Ned Evarts, the horse trader, but as it
was, the farmer had to figure out the mystery by
himself. The strange procession came on up the road
and turned without hesitation into the lane. Mr.
Meadows stared curiously at the sombreroed driver
and the odd assortment of horses. Due to the initial
resentment at Jim&rsquo;s having traded the gold watch
for Ticktock, the horse trader and his unusual cavalcade
had never been discussed much by Jim and his
father. It was only as the wagon stopped and the
driver climbed down that Mr. Meadows began to
suspect the identity of his visitor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Evarts,&rdquo; said the old man, introducing
himself. &ldquo;Are you Meadows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Carl Meadows, shaking hands
with Evarts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last spring I swapped your son a horse. Still
got him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure have. He&rsquo;s over there in the orchard,&rdquo; replied
Jim&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s him all right,&rdquo; said the horse trader,
shading his eyes from the sun with one hand while
he looked at Ticktock. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lookin&rsquo; much better than
when I saw him last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been getting good care,&rdquo; said Carl Meadows,
grinning. &ldquo;In fact he&rsquo;s practically been fed with a
spoon lately.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I traded with your boy I was a bit doubtful
about the deal, as he gave me a gold watch for
the horse,&rdquo; said Evarts. &ldquo;I asked him if he was sure
it was all right, and he reckoned it was. Some days
later I happened to take the watch apart again and
I noticed that engravin&rsquo; on the back. While I ain&rsquo;t
doubtin&rsquo; that the watch belonged to your son, I figured
you might set a big store by it, seein&rsquo; it&rsquo;s been
in the family so long. Anyhow I held onto it and if
you&rsquo;re a mind to trade back, I still have the watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wrong on so many counts concerning
that horse it&rsquo;s getting kinda monotonous,&rdquo; said Mr.
Meadows almost to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Evarts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. No, I wouldn&rsquo;t consider trading back,&rdquo;
said Mr. Meadows stoutly. &ldquo;I was a bit mad at the
time, but Jim sure knew what he was doing. Now
I wouldn&rsquo;t swap that mustang for your whole string.
I&rsquo;d like to buy the watch though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about forty-five dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough. I&rsquo;ll buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made money on that horse after all,&rdquo; said the
old man, grinning as he pocketed his money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did, because that mustang is just
about the most valuable horse in the country. Also
the most famous in the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he done?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing he&rsquo;s just recovered from a
broken leg. Had the cannon bone broken and you&rsquo;d
never know it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be hanged,&rdquo; said Evarts in amazement,
as he walked toward the orchard fence. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d he
break it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The barn caught on fire one night and he broke
out. He jumped the fence and broke his leg when
he landed. That&rsquo;s what woke us. Must have saved
me a thousand dollars worth of stock. I had the barn
insured against fire but not the stock. That&rsquo;s just
one of the reasons why we wouldn&rsquo;t part with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure pleased you&rsquo;re satisfied with him.
As I said, I was a bit worried at the time, tradin&rsquo;
with a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve quit worrying about Jim getting beat in a
trade,&rdquo; said Mr. Meadows proudly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite a
businessman. I guess he made at least seventy-five
dollars with that horse during the summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Meadows was still recounting Ticktock&rsquo;s exploits
when Jim returned from school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Mr. Evarts!&rdquo; he shouted as he came through
the gate. &ldquo;How do you like the looks of my horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful. He looks like he&rsquo;d found horse
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention that watch,&rdquo; warned Mr. Meadows
as Jim approached. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll surprise him on his birthday.
Not very often you can give the same present
twice. Probably end up with an elephant this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ticktock came trotting up to the fence to welcome
his master. He stuck his nose over the top wire, begging
for some tidbit. Surprisingly enough it was
Mr. Meadows who reached in his pocket and produced
a sugar cube. He held it in his outstretched
palm. Ticktock could see plainly enough that it was
sugar, but he hesitated. Mr. Meadows had long since
forgotten his old hostility but the mustang remembered.
However, he wasn&rsquo;t the horse to hold a
grudge; so he looked inquiringly at Jim. Jim grinned
and nodded his head.</p>
<p>Ticktock reached out to take the sugar.</p>
